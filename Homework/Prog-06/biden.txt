Millions of people are out of work. Small businesses are closing. People are struggling to pay their bills, stay in their homes, and put food on the table.  Congress needs to pass a relief package immediately.
When I think of climate change, I think about jobs. Good-paying, union jobs that put Americans to work, make our air cleaner, and rebuild America’s crumbling infrastructure.

Today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, I reaffirm my commitment to ending this epidemic. A Biden-Harris administration will take bold action here at home and rejoin global efforts to confront gender-based violence in all its forms.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made matters worse, creating a “shadow pandemic” for many women and girls who are largely confined to their home with their abuser and facing economic insecurity that makes escape more difficult.
As many as 1 in 3 women is the victim of gender-based violence at some point in her life, and that rate is even higher for women of color, lesbian and bisexual women, transgender individuals, and other members of vulnerable or underserved communities.
The challenge before us right now is immense — we need bold action to fight this pandemic. That’s why @KamalaHarris and I are getting right to work preparing to get this virus under control.
I believe America is strongest when we work with our allies.  It's how we keep this country safe, counter terrorism and extremism, control this pandemic, deal with the climate crisis, and so much more.
While this team has unmatched experience and accomplishments, they also reflect the idea that we cannot meet the challenges we face with old thinking or unchanged habits.  https://t.co/o9NWy59drg

This team is ready to lead the world, not retreat from it.  Ready to confront our adversaries, not reject our allies.  And ready to stand up for our values.  https://t.co/DC0K6cJmpo

At least 37 transgender and gender-nonconforming people have been killed this year, most of them Black and Brown transgender women. It’s intolerable. This Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor their lives—and recommit to the work that remains to end this epidemic of violence.

When we build back better, we will do so with higher wages — including a $15 minimum wage — better benefits and stronger collective bargaining rights that you can raise a family on.  That’s how we will build back the middle class better than ever.
Right now, Congress should come together and pass a COVID relief package like the HEROES Act that the House passed six months ago. Once we shut down the virus and deliver economic relief to workers and businesses, then we can build back better than ever before.

Once again, I congratulate the brilliant women and men who produced this breakthrough and have brought us one step closer to beating this virus. I am also thankful for the frontline workers who are still confronting the virus around the clock.
Today's news of a second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful. What was true with the first vaccine remains true with the second: we are still months away. Until then, Americans need to continue to practice social-distancing and mask-wearing to get the virus under control.
Congratulations to NASA and SpaceX on today's launch. It’s a testament to the power of science and what we can accomplish by harnessing our innovation, ingenuity, and determination. I join all Americans and the people of Japan in wishing the astronauts Godspeed on their journey.

I am the president-elect, but will not be president until next year. COVID-19 does not respect dates on the calendar, it is accelerating right now. Urgent action is needed today, now, by the current administration.
I am alarmed by the surge in reported COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities. This crisis demands a robust and immediate federal response which has been woefully lacking.
As the remnants of Tropical Storm Eta continue to impact the east coast, I encourage everyone in its path to heed the warnings of emergency responders and local officials. Jill and I send our prayers to those facing yet another storm.
Today marks five years since the horrific ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris — an assault not just on the people of France but against our common humanity.  As president, I will work to protect Americans and our allies, countering terrorism and extremist violence in all forms.
I extend my deep condolences to the loved ones of the peacekeepers, including 6 American service members, who died on Tiran Island, and wish a speedy recovery to the surviving American. I join all Americans in honoring their sacrifice, as I keep their loved ones in my prayers.

The bottom line: I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around.
The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing, and so is the need for bold action to fight this pandemic.
My COVID-19 Transition Advisory Board will advise on detailed plans built on a bedrock of science, and that keep compassion, empathy, and care for every American at its core.

From the bottom of my heart: thank you.  https://t.co/s76oHFkr66
A nation united.  A nation strengthened.  A nation healed.  The United States of America.
With full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with a love of country — and a thirst for justice — let us be the nation that we know we can be.
Tonight, the whole world is watching America. I believe at our best America is a beacon for the globe.  And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
Especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest — the African American community stood up again for me. They always have my back, and I’ll have yours.
I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate.  That’s the choice I’ll make. And I call on the Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — to make that choice with me.
Now that the campaign is over—what is the people’s will? What is our mandate?  I believe it is this: Americans have called on us to marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness. To marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time.
We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life’s most precious moments — hugging a grandchild, birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us — until we get this virus under control.
The Bible tells us that to everything there is a season — a time to build, a time to reap, a time to sow. And a time to heal.  This is the time to heal in America.
It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric.  To lower the temperature.  To see each other again.  To listen to each other again.
To all those who volunteered, worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local election officials — you deserve a special thanks from this nation.
For America’s educators, this is a great day: You’re going to have one of your own in the White House, and Jill is going to make a great First Lady.
I pledge to be a President who seeks not to divide, but to unify.  Who doesn’t see Red and Blue states, but a United States.  And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people.

We may be opponents — but we are not enemies.   We are Americans.
We have to remember the purpose of our politics isn’t totally unrelenting warfare.
I know tensions can be high after a tough election like we just had.  But we need to remain calm. Patient. And let the process work out as we count all the votes.
We are going to be the first Democrats to win Arizona in 24 years.  We are going to be the first Democrats to win Georgia in 28 years.  And we re-built the Blue Wall in the middle of the country that crumbled just four years ago.
What is becoming clearer each hour is that record numbers of Americans — from all races, faiths, regions — chose change over more of the same.   They have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism.
The numbers tell us a clear and convincing story: We're going to win this race.

To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies.
Once this election is finalized and behind us, it will be time for us to do what we've always done as Americans: To put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us.
Every vote must be counted. No one is going to take our democracy away from us, not now, not ever.
The presidency, itself, is not a partisan institution. It's the one office in the nation that represents everyone and it demands a duty of care for all Americans, and that is precisely what I will do.
Power can't be taken or asserted, it flows from the people, and it's their will that determines who will be the President of the United States.

When America votes, America will be heard. And when America is heard, I believe the message is going to be loud and clear: It’s time for Donald Trump to leave the White House.
A Biden-Harris administration will:  - Implement nationwide mask mandates - Ensure access to regular, reliable, and free testing - Accelerate the development and distribution of safe and effective treatments and vaccines  We won’t waste any time getting this virus under control.
Health care.  Civil rights. Climate change.  Economic inequality.  Racial justice. The Supreme Court. Our democracy.  They’re all at stake. Vote.  https://t.co/eoxT07d7QB

In public, President Trump compared COVID-19 to the flu and suggested people inject bleach to treat it.  In private, he told Bob Woodward it was deadlier than the flu and that he wanted to downplay it.  It’s unthinkable.
I have always believed you can define America in one word: possibilities. And I refuse to postpone those possibilities any longer.  There is so much we can achieve as a nation with Donald Trump out of the White House.

It’s hard to believe it’s been a year since we lost my friend Senator Kay Hagan. Kay was a relentless champion for North Carolina and a fierce defender of its citizens. May her legacy continue to inspire a new generation of leaders to follow in her steps.

If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other — then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future.   That is our work. That is our pledge. That is our mission.

As president, I’ll protect and build on Obamacare by:  - Giving Americans the choice to buy a new public option - Lowering premiums, deductibles, and co-pays - Standing up to prescription drug corporations  We’re going to make sure every American has access to the care they need.

I give you my word: If I am elected president, I will marshal the ingenuity and goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together.
As president, I will embrace:  Hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. Light, not darkness.   I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst.
We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.  And by fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation.  Those better angels must prevail again.
The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn’t care where you live or what political party you belong to.  It infects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It is a virus — not a political weapon.
I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America.
As president, I will send a clear, unequivocal message to the entire nation: There is no place for hate in America.  It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It will be given no safe harbor.
We are engaged once again in a battle for the soul of the nation. It’s a battle we’ve been in before and we can win again. Tune in as I deliver remarks from Gettysburg.  https://t.co/I9KItf8Fjn

I’m happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.
Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response:  - Over 200,000 Americans have died - 26 million are on unemployment - 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure  We can’t let him.
When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, “Joe Biden: For all our families.”  It’s a motto that has guided me throughout my career.  It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican—I’ll be a president for all Americans, not just the ones who vote for me.
On Native Women's Equal Pay Day, we recognize the hard truth that Native women earn just $0.57 for every dollar a white man makes. It's unacceptable.  A Biden-Harris Administration will stand with women in Indian Country and pass legislation to close the gender wage gap.  https://t.co/RstWRwFc2J
During Filipino American History Month, we celebrate the community's immense contributions to our country — from early immigrants to the millions today, many who serve in the military or as frontline workers. As President, I'll work alongside them to protect the American people.

The American people deserve to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is.  https://t.co/jnFXiDkt2c
President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he’s in Court trying to rip their protections away.  And now, he’s trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done.  We can’t let him win.
I’m about to step on stage to debate Donald Trump for the first time. But before I do, can you chip in to show him the power of our grassroots base? Every donation — big or small — goes a long way.  https://t.co/HiNSLIqIPQ

If we’re elected, @KamalaHarris and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class. For Main Street. For the folks who keep our country running.  We’re going to make our government work for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
You deserve a president who tells you the truth.  https://t.co/YcIMDYZr66
It’s grassroots donors like you who power our campaign. And I’m counting on you to help us meet our end-of-quarter fundraising goal.  If you’re able, please chip in before tomorrow night’s big deadline:  https://t.co/JDpr6U0evX

With casualties rapidly mounting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trump Administration needs to call the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. It must also demand others — like Turkey — stay out of this conflict.  https://t.co/C41YKEGTyA
The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance.  But Donald Trump doesn't care — he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions.  It's unconscionable.
I believe there's no greater economic engine in the world than the hard work and ingenuity of the American people — and I witnessed it firsthand last week in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.  Together, we're going to make sure the future is made here in America.  https://t.co/tw7tv6sPKT
Folks, this is a big week for our campaign: Tomorrow, I face Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first time — and Wednesday is our final end-of-quarter fundraising deadline.  We can't afford to fall short here. Chip in today:  https://t.co/PBlWnV8pBr

There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years — and now they see an opening to get it done.  We can't let them get away with it.

Thank you @TheRock for your support at this critical moment for our nation.  You said it best: This election is about earning the respect of the American people. It’s about decency.

In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare.  Health care is at stake. Protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake.  We can't let them win.  https://t.co/zIdPmxzYtQ
The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.
Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions.  The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.  Americans deserve to be heard.
Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act.  Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is.  https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K
When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus.  After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously "disappear."  Now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short.  It's a national tragedy.

At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.  We need a president who believes in science.
Today is Public Lands Day and National Hunting and Fishing Day — and what better way to celebrate than the long overdue removal of William Perry Pendley from @blmnational. It's a victory for everyone who values our public lands over those who want to exploit them for profit.
If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19.  Minutes after the race is called, I’ll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on.  During my transition, I’ll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  We will overcome this, together.

The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us.  It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating.  It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone.
We are in the middle of a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet.  We have to vote him out.  https://t.co/NkSJ7bvBoE
Obamacare was—and is—a big deal. As president, I’ll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give Americans the opportunity to choose a new public option.  We’re going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need.  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
Health care is a right — not a privilege.
In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.  Don't forget that.
Thank you, @CindyMcCain. Your support and your friendship mean the world to me. John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward — it's what I'll do every day as president.  https://t.co/KheAlsKt73
I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week.  Now, the Senate and President Trump need to reauthorize VAWA. It's long overdue.
Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better.
The Trump Administration says "the entire ACA must fall."  They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic.  We can't let him win.  https://t.co/bcwiGz1HOn

200,000 Americans have died from this virus.  It’s a staggering number that’s hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.  There’s a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can’t forget that.
While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing.  Now, nearly 200,000 Americans have died.  It didn’t have to happen this way.  https://t.co/RqdLtARlRW
Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost.  Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you.  Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith.
Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.
When the virus came, President Trump wasn’t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.  It’s how Trump looks at the world: It’s always about him, never about us.  You deserve a president who will put you first.

The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.   Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.   Let that sink in.
If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.  The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families.  We're going to reward work — not wealth.
.@realDonaldTrump, the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it.
We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing.    We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.  The stakes are too high.

The fact is, Iran is closer to a nuclear bomb today than it was when Donald Trump took office.  Every day he’s in charge of our national security is another day our enemies are emboldened and the American people are at risk.  https://t.co/hEMkpGARuo
When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks “hoax.”   I think “jobs.”  Good paying, union jobs that put Americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation.  https://t.co/AKl9jZKB0s

I promise that as president, I’ll make reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act a top priority and continue working to end gender-based violence.  https://t.co/wmN7bSAUVg
With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger.  The latest bill—passed by the House last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women.  But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It’s despicable.
26 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence.  Writing and championing the law remains one of my proudest accomplishments.  https://t.co/9pV7X9fgKq

26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—it was an effort I was proud to champion.  These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire.  As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and we’ll ban them once again.
This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.  Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.  Jill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery.
In a Biden-Harris administration, “Buy American” will be more than a slogan.   We’re going to invest an additional $400 billion in purchasing American-made products and keep good-paying jobs here at home.  https://t.co/HrOOkXerMP

I promise you that if I’m elected president, I’ll never forget what the job is about. It’s about you — the American people.  https://t.co/ACGjYymWSg
Iran’s cruel execution of Navid Afkari is a travesty. No country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists.   Iran must free its other political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained Americans.
As president, I’ll impose a tax penalty on companies that ship jobs overseas and sell products back to the U.S. — and I’ll create millions of good-paying jobs here at home.  We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America's workers.  https://t.co/8smOm5MGx1
The science is clear, and deadly signs like the fires out West are unmistakable — climate change poses an existential threat to our way of life.  We must act now to avoid a future defined by tragedies like the one American families are enduring today.  https://t.co/iGNTQVOy3t
You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better.  I promise that’s exactly what @KamalaHarris and I will do.
Always remember.  https://t.co/BwaBSo8LFq
And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation — so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.
Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service.
This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans.
Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country.  https://t.co/6rAF0dAd1Y
As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does — unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it.  https://t.co/Ogn7Sbvq1Q
Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.
More than 1,000 people died from COVID yesterday.  @realDonaldTrump watched eight hours of TV.  If I’m president, you might not always agree with me. But I promise you I will always show up and fight for you.  https://t.co/HvVJLS83TZ
Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard.  These are frontline workers against COVID-19, responsible for testing and distributing food and medical supplies.  Michiganders need a pandemic response—not a pep rally.
Do your part. Wear a mask.  https://t.co/pdnEecS49Q
Make no mistake: Climate change is already here — and we’re witnessing its devastating effects every single day.   We have to get President Trump out of the White House and treat this crisis like the existential threat that it is.  https://t.co/NXzkpaRVsY

How many more people have to suffer because of President Trump's lies?  https://t.co/m2spzGCKgd
Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.
I got to meet Lou Brock back in March. I joked that I had really just come to St. Louis to see him—and let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. Lou was a true legend and a man of integrity. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time.  https://t.co/ZStoBAnk7V
Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it.  Now, nearly 200,000 Americans are dead.  It’s unconscionable.  https://t.co/SLqqhmWy8E
You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone.   Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.  It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
Roberto Clemente was an incredible baseball player. He was a barrier breaker and a humanitarian. As he rose to fame, he lifted the Black and Latino communities with him.  I may be a Phillies fan, but I’m always proud to honor the legacy of #21.  https://t.co/ZWSfIBUD0p
I promise you that if I’m elected, I’ll always tell you the truth.  I’ll listen to the experts and do everything I can to contain this virus.  And I’ll always put your health and safety first — no matter the political cost.
Donald Trump knew.  He lied to us for months.  And while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job — on purpose.  It was a life or death betrayal of the American people.

Given his track record, no one can take Trump’s word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.  https://t.co/074K1HD9wf
3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics?   President Trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every American — not just the wealthy and well-connected — receives the vaccine.
2: Who will validate that the Administration’s decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation?   We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.
1: What criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy?  The FDA must clarify what criteria it will use, and President Trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the FDA.
A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible.  But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool.  Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:
Donald Trump is incapable of providing the leadership this moment requires.

Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida.   Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable.   You don't have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling.

Mr. President — If you’re so good at making deals, then why does your trade deal cost American workers so much pain while letting China off the hook for its biggest trade abuses?  https://t.co/mL8a67CTAw

Wall Street didn't build this country — the middle class did. And unions built the middle class.  Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.
It's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. As president, I’ll:  - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits
For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions.   It will end on my watch.  I'll sign the PRO Act — making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain — and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.
Together, we can build a future that reflects working people’s courage and ambition. One that not only offers good jobs — but the dignity, equity, shared prosperity, and common purpose due to every American.  https://t.co/FDLGMKCgWD
The 40-hour workweek Minimum wage Overtime pay Health care  Workplace safety protections  They’re all because of unions — and it’s time we recognize that.

We need to restore honor and decency to the White House.
Time and again, the president has refused to provide Puerto Rico with much-needed resources. He’s repeatedly insulted Puerto Ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island.   This ends when I’m elected president.
Donald Trump promised to be "the greatest jobs president God ever created."  But in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered.  American workers can't take four more years of his failed leadership.

As president, I will:  - Call for nationwide mask mandates - Implement widespread testing - Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines  I’m ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.
Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. Instead, they’re being deported back into the tyrannical grip of Daniel Ortega without a chance to pursue their claims.  President Trump’s cruelty truly knows no bounds.

Now is not the time for a victory lap, Mr. President. Just because your wealthy friends and donors are doing well doesn't mean everyone else is.  Get off the golf course. Call the leaders of Congress to the White House. And make a deal that delivers for working people.
The fact is we're more than six months into this pandemic, and:  - 11.5 million Americans don't have their jobs back - Almost 30 million are on unemployment - We're down 720,000 manufacturing jobs - Nearly 1 in 6 small businesses have closed their doors
I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope — but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report.  The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June.

More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.  Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed.  Do you really feel safer under Trump?
Mr. President, it’s high time you condemn violence of any form.
Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe.  Well, he is president — whether he knows it or not.
Trump and Pence are running on this: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”  And what’s their proof?  The violence you’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America.
The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now, he’s trying to scare America.
I want a safe America — safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops.   And let’s be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump.
Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.

We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:   COVID. Economic devastation. Unwarranted police violence. Emboldened white nationalists. A reckoning on race. Declining faith in a bright American future.  The common thread? A president who makes things worse — not better.

Donald Trump has been president for almost four years.  The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper.  And all of us are less safe because he can’t do the job of the American president.
We must not become a country at war with ourselves.  A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another.  But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.

Donald Trump put our nation on the sidelines. Let’s get back in the game.  https://t.co/e8VsW5IsNi
I know from personal experience how important access to quality, affordable health care is for a family. I know the peace of mind it brings.  It's why as president, I promise I'll protect your children's health care as if they were my own.  https://t.co/kqiKt8ISXj
As we mark the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, we must continue the hard work of perfecting our union. It's up to all of us to carry on the march toward equality, liberty, and justice for all.
I am grateful for your friendship and leadership, @AbeShinzo. I’m sad to see you step down, but I know the strong alliance between our countries and peoples will continue for generations to come. Wishing you good health in the years ahead, my friend.  https://t.co/M0cMT5y9Dd
Mr. President, Americans are canceling weddings and holding funerals without family. They're sacrificing so more Americans don't have to die.  But instead of leading by example, you hosted a super spreader event on the South Lawn.  When will you take the presidency seriously?
We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.  This is a moment of action.  It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer.
Times of crisis often bring out our best as Americans — and we're seeing that right now in the aftermath of Hurricane Laura. Thank you to all of our emergency responders who are working around the clock to help people get back on their feet.
Tonight is yet another reminder of what's at stake in this election.   Who we are, what we stand for, and who we want to be — it's all on the ballot this November.  We have to beat Donald Trump. Chip in to help us do it:  https://t.co/dWIpEPQcqQ
It’s time we bring integrity back to the White House.  https://t.co/KDPLITstKA
Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency.
Leadership requires foresight.
From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.  Now, we’re paying the price.
Donald Trump promised to be the greatest jobs president God ever created.  Instead, tens of millions of Americans are out of work and we're facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. #PromisesBroken  https://t.co/JzjZu7KKRr
Donald Trump didn't build a wall around America, the world built a wall around us.  https://t.co/lLY8S92cSb

Donald Trump calls himself a wartime president. But now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he’s waved the white flag.  He abandoned the American people when we needed him most.
When President Trump took office, he inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And just like everything else he’s inherited in his life, he squandered it.  https://t.co/tTBD8lRC1c
President Trump has failed our nation.  https://t.co/w792IB79kK
- 180,000 lives lost - Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 - Over 25 million Americans out of work - Countless small businesses on the brink of closing  That's Donald Trump's America. We're living it every day. We can't take four more years.
When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?
This news is deeply disturbing — as an alum of @UDelaware and as an American. We need a full and swift investigation into what happened Tuesday night.   With anti-Semitism on the rise across the country, we all have a moral obligation to speak out and give hate no safe harbor.
President Trump doesn’t want a second term. He wants a do-over.  As he takes the stage tonight, remember: he alone is responsible for the chaos in our country.  Together, we can stop it.  https://t.co/iKcrLuEC9N
Donald Trump and Republicans must have forgotten about the 180,000 American lives lost due to COVID-19.  I promise you that, as president, I never will.

Immigrants are not your political props, Mr. President.

The cruelty of this president truly knows no bounds. We can’t let him gut Social Security and eliminate funding for disability benefits.
To lead America, you have to understand America.  I know how hard it is for folks who are sick, struggling, and wondering how they'll get through the day.  You deserve a president who will fight for you and lead our nation out of these crises. I'll get started on day one.  https://t.co/evrWlwqhh1
Jill and I are praying for the safety of those in the path of Hurricane Laura. If you are in an impacted area, please heed the advice of local officials.
The contrast tonight couldn't be clearer:  We can choose four more years of fear, division, and hate.  Or we can choose a different path — one of hope, unity, and light.  Let's overcome this era of darkness, together:  https://t.co/agUqzkqkXT
180,000 people have died from this COVID crisis. And the heartbreaking truth is that it didn't have to happen this way.
This moment demands moral leadership. And these players answered by standing up, speaking out, and using their platform for good.  Now is not the time for silence.
100 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was certified, giving some women the right to vote.  But we still have further to go.  We must carry forward the banner of equality and create that more perfect union we've always strived to be. #WomensEqualityDay  https://t.co/v46l5SyLJe

President Obama and I established a White House office to prepare our nation for future pandemics. Donald Trump eliminated it — and we've been paying the price every single day.
As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.   Because I understand something this president doesn't.    We will never get our economy back on track until we deal with this virus.
.@DrBiden and I are keeping everyone in the path of storms Laura and Marco in our prayers. Please take steps to prepare, heed the warnings of local authorities, and stay safe.
America is at an inflection point.   We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.  Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light.
31 years after they joined hands to demand freedom from Soviet oppression, citizens of the Baltic states formed a human chain in solidarity with Belarusians fighting to throw off the chains of dictatorship.  We stand with the people of Belarus as we stood with the Baltic nations.

If we want to build back better and deliver real change for the American people, then we've got to flip the U.S. Senate. And the path to doing so runs right through Maine. Thank you, @SaraGideon for being with us tonight. #DemConvention  https://t.co/1eyIpC81vC
No family should go through the pain that Kristin and her family have gone through. #DemConvention  https://t.co/LgyabNxxFy

George Floyd had a giving spirit. I see that in his family, I see that in his daughter.   George Floyd should be alive today. #DemConvention  https://t.co/hGqZysA5Ng
Thank you, Congressman Clyburn.  https://t.co/8E3h8sjabu
These last few months have been a wake-up call for our nation. It's up to all of us to do the work to create that more perfect union we've always strived to be. I'm proud of @DemConvention for tonight's powerful conversation on racial justice. #DemConvention  https://t.co/Iij5J752xB

We’re just over an hour away from night one of the @DemConvention. I hope you’ll join me and Democrats across the country as we unite around our vision for a better America.  Tune in at 9 PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/Gh4ZGgPWXH
Just imagine where we would be right now if we had a president who listened to the scientists.
Secretary Esper and President Trump, it's a president's job to protect the health and safety of our troops and their families. Gutting the military health care system — no less during a global pandemic — is unacceptable.  https://t.co/lXpcSdm8au
There are only 78 days until Election Day — and @KamalaHarris and I need your help to make Donald Trump a one-term president.  Sign up today and let’s get to work:  https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS
We may be physically apart, but this week Democrats are coming together from across the nation to put forth our vision for a better America. #DemConvention  Tune in tonight at 9 PM ET to join us:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq
The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better.   We've got to create an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected.
As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences.  She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House.
Here’s my promise to you: If I’m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide.   I’ll take responsibility instead of blaming others.   I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
Donald Trump and Congress need to act now to deliver the relief the American people need.  https://t.co/YhlPXPspcS

We need nationwide mask mandates.
Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert’s passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one — and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all.
We can meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. We just need a president and vice president ready and willing to lead.  https://t.co/HqfHD0qB4y

William Perry Pendley has no business working at @blmnational and I'm happy to see his nomination to lead it withdrawn. In a Biden Administration, folks who spend their careers selling off public lands won't get anywhere near being tapped to protect them.  https://t.co/a0GsuoCVpn
This was a big week for our campaign: @KamalaHarris joined me on the ticket and we had our best fundraising week yet. Together, we are building the coalition that will beat Donald Trump.  Chip in if you’re able to keep the momentum going:  https://t.co/MIxfjbChaW
I know a thing or two about being Vice President — and I know @KamalaHarris is the best partner I could have for the fight ahead.

We’ve got to protect and expand Social Security — I’ll get it done as President.  https://t.co/hnkhh6I1ar
I know just how important Social Security is for countless Americans. That's why as president, I'll protect and strengthen it — not defund it.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I filled out our paperwork to get on the ballot in November.  Now, we're counting on you to do your part to make sure you're set to vote.  Get registered today:  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M  https://t.co/JzAonY8TCg
The fate of Social Security is on the ballot in November. As President, I will never, ever defund Social Security. I’ll strengthen it.  Anything less is a failure of a president’s most important duty: to care for the American people.  https://t.co/1GaFbdd6u7
People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis.  The virus isn’t taking a break — Republicans shouldn’t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back and pass a relief bill. Now.
What kind of president tries to defund Social Security during an economic crisis?  https://t.co/FO47IjABTF
Voting by mail is safe and secure. And don't take my word for it: Take it from the President, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the Florida primary on Tuesday.
Today marks 85 years since the Social Security Act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. Now we’re living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to Social Security — not defund it.
The choice we make this November will decide the future of America.  I have no doubt @KamalaHarris is the right partner to join me to lead our nation through this moment.  https://t.co/YdJFksiCrI

I know @KamalaHarris will work every single day to make life better for all Americans and build this nation back better than before.  https://t.co/8hTslszBPC
I first met @KamalaHarris through my son Beau. They grew close while fighting to take on the big banks — and he had enormous respect for her and her work.  There is no one’s opinion I valued more than Beau’s, and I’m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.
.@DrBiden and I are keeping the people of Iowa and everyone impacted by Monday's derecho in our prayers. We've got to make sure Iowans and those across the midwest get the relief they need for a quick and full recovery.

Heather Heyer was a brave young woman who saw what was happening in her hometown of Charlottesville and decided to fight against it.   Let us honor her memory by continuing to stand against hate.
Three years ago today, white supremacists descended on Charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their hearts. Our president said they were "very fine people."   It was clear then, and it's clear now: We are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we must win.
Let's get to work, @KamalaHarris.  https://t.co/EjtUpgaieI
One of the reasons I chose @KamalaHarris is because we both believe you can define America in one simple word — possibilities.
If you’re worried about whether you’ll have a job, worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you drink, worried about your civil rights or even your basic dignity being under attack—@KamalaHarris has had your back. Now, we have to have hers.
Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president.   That’s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.
This morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents.
We’ve all watched @KamalaHarris in the Senate go toe-to-toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked — and not stopping until she gets an answer. She’s ready to do this job.
This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I will be speaking together for the first time since yesterday’s big announcement. Tune in:  https://t.co/xoRbSqGta8
RT @TeamJoe: 🚨 TODAY AT 3:50PM: Tune in live as @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris — the future President and Vice President of the United States…
Whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality—Kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. It's why I chose her to be my running mate.  She'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country.
As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand.  Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans.
If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we’re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won’t have a minute to waste.   That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one.
.@KamalaHarris is the daughter of proud immigrants—a mother from India and a father from Jamaica—who raised her to take action. That’s exactly what this moment calls for: action. And we hope you’ll take action with us:  https://t.co/K3mVwfTxXJ  https://t.co/MZLAx9IN6C
Right now, America faces:    - The worst pandemic in 100 years - The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression - The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation   I need someone alongside me who's smart, tough, and ready to lead. @KamalaHarris is that person.

Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.
I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate.
Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless.  I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need.  https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h
I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.  I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  We'll get it done, together.
This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong. Instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with Xi Jinping.  I'll put American values back at the center of our foreign policy.
Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement — giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career — and I'll continue that fight as president.
Folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. Wear a mask. It’s not just about you. It’s about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe.  https://t.co/pbI6UVhqvh
Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO.  https://t.co/RG38v0dRDk
Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security.  We can't let that happen.
President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable.  I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans.
Donald Trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans.   After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do:  https://t.co/SOVOPL7uPy
To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you — and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you.
Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
We can’t let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
Our planet can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.

Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November.  https://t.co/iIFPTIB1Er
The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn’t have gotten this bad.
Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.  Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt.  https://t.co/glUDQlcbEO
Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world.  https://t.co/owvNL4ul74

Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before.
The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day.  https://t.co/sZJCdivRo3
Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer.
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.
Over the last century, America has defined itself by rising to meet existential challenges — and we have that opportunity once again. But we can’t just build back to the way things were before, we have to build back better.  Here’s my plan for how we’ll do it:  https://t.co/nuBqg0TIfP
John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America.  Donald Trump will not.  https://t.co/vfZFeCUX3S
I can’t believe I have to say this, but we can’t let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining.
I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.
It didn't have to be this bad.  https://t.co/xwdxgizLLH
Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans.  It's time we pick a different path.  https://t.co/rt5RD9WOGA
Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump’s failure to get this virus under control.  https://t.co/CBbk6SV39Q
While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job.  https://t.co/eIHGRjwJd3
The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price.  https://t.co/JOgA5Gpop4
Here’s how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump—Ducey model:  - An infection rate—still—of nearly 20% - The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country - More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19 - More than 183,000 cases - Lengthy delays in test results
Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.  He’s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it.  He’s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk.
President Trump called Arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” He said Governor Ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in Arizona:
My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.
Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place.
Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all.
I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we’ve got to:  - Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act - Enact automatic and same-day voter registration - Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts
John Lewis left us with marching orders. It’s up to all of us to carry them out:  https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M  https://t.co/MTc6WHNnSR
Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I’ve learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can.  https://t.co/qCsvryHMai
Let me be clear: Voting is a right — not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can’t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law.  https://t.co/fHqUvYahRR
55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we’ve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote.
The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict—and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used.  https://t.co/357jRzBPeL

Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs, but his policies crushed the manufacturing sector—and that was true even before COVID-19.  I’ll revitalize American manufacturing and innovation and create millions of good-paying jobs so we can build back better.  https://t.co/HrOOkWWQof
Growing up in Scranton, I learned the importance of hard work, treating others with dignity and respect, and leaving no one behind. Those values have guided my entire life — and they're the values I'll bring back to the White House.  https://t.co/aelfrxaISg
Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I’m announcing my running mate, and I promise I’ll let you know soon. But here’s what I can tell you right now: I’m going to tell my supporters first — so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know.
I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. As president, I'll make bold investments in American manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America.  https://t.co/LkIi8g6M5i
There's been a lot of talk about my vetting process lately. Here’s an inside look:  https://t.co/tFRKJOE3hi
Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the @NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons — and as president, I’ll ban these weapons again.  https://t.co/ggqSaj40EJ
Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence.
I truly believe that we can revitalize American manufacturing and create a better economy at the same time. I want to build an economy that brings everyone along — one that works for the middle class, not just the wealthy and well-connected.  https://t.co/3fYbFfsvDb
The truth of the matter is, Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he inherited in his life, he squandered it.  https://t.co/EPxDx4ecoU
From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action.   Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership.
On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress creating a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and the 11 million undocumented people already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue.  https://t.co/ajO7uUb9po
Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut. I urge both the Trump Administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast.
Thousands of Americans are dying every week. The President's response?  "It is what it is."  https://t.co/GT59hr14kb

The Latino community is bearing disproportionate harm from this pandemic. But even before, many Latino families were already struggling. We've got to do better. That's why today, I'm releasing my new agenda for the Latino community:  https://t.co/xgGUoleGQO
As president, I’ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic.
One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver.
On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to "just disappear."  He was wrong — and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month.  Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one.
When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products and support American jobs. Period.  We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America:  https://t.co/uTI6GyuTpX
Not a joke, folks.  Get yours today:  https://t.co/RqCQJE8Kho  https://t.co/A1CNMOu2ct

Jill and I mourn the loss of the nine service members who perished in a training accident off the coast of California. These brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their fellow Americans. Our deepest condolences go out to their families.

In the days that followed the El Paso shooting, I said Americans have to come together, stand against hate, and leave nobody behind.  That charge feels more important than ever. This is our fight — and together, we will win.  https://t.co/eX2xD0jhjX
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I’ll spend my Monday mornings working with our nation’s top experts to control this virus — not insulting them on Twitter.
This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.  It won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win.
One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.  He was wrong.  https://t.co/d7ISze6dK7

It’s not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises — we need to build back better than ever. We have to create a new American economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
Now more than ever, we need a president who believes in science.
This pandemic has put a bright light on the disparities that have plagued our nation for too long. We’ve got to make sure these communities get the help they need now — and root out the systemic racism that created these inequalities in the first place.  https://t.co/KZZx2T9ojT
Enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight.  We don’t have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus.  Our health care workers still don’t have enough PPE.  Enough with the weekend golf trips, Mr. President. Do your job.
Rent is due today.  Donald Trump abdicated his responsibility to lead us out of this COVID-19 crisis—and we now face a potential housing crisis because of it.  Mr. President: Act now to make sure Americans don't have to choose between a roof over their heads or food on the table.  https://t.co/b0Uoy5qoFr
You have enough on your plate — you shouldn't also have to worry about the president making things even tougher for you.  https://t.co/HjwhG8kQMT
If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of this nation.  We can’t let that happen.
To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country run: I see you, and I promise I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America.  https://t.co/009KRZx9Bq
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and it's being written every day by folks like Dr. @Craig_A_Spencer, who fought the Ebola outbreak and now COVID-19. @BarackObama and I called to thank him for his service and discuss the moment we're in.  https://t.co/wO14pwaaxa
Folks, we’re just a few hours away from our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline. We need everyone to step up so we can hit our goal and make sure we can go toe-to-toe with President Trump.  If you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/XAsy8zaW2v
Jill and I are keeping everyone in the path of Hurricane Isaias in our prayers. We must ensure that our fellow Americans, in Puerto Rico and across the East Coast, get the support they need. Please heed the warnings from authorities, take steps to prepare, and stay safe.

We’re facing some of the biggest challenges in our history — and it’s abundantly clear Donald Trump just isn’t up for the job.  We need real leadership — and we need it now.
It’s been over six months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, and President Trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day.
.@DrBiden and I wish all our Muslim friends and neighbors a blessed #EidAlAdha. May your sacrifices on this day be accepted and strengthen you during these challenging times. Eid Mubarak!
Human trafficking is an unconscionable attack on the dignity of the most vulnerable among us. Action can’t wait — on this World Day Against Trafficking in Persons, we’ve got to join together and commit to ending trafficking. #EndHumanTrafficking  https://t.co/5UJHwaMRQI

Throughout his life, John Lewis taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.  It's up to all of us to carry on his mission.  https://t.co/VUJdegsBuw
It’s time Senate Republicans back their effusive praise of John Lewis with action. Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.

The last three months were the worst period for economic growth our nation has experienced in the 70 years since we started measuring it — a drop of nearly 33 percent.  Let's be clear: This is no act of God, it's a failure of presidential leadership.  https://t.co/pPZXkHtJcR
I'm the proud husband of a teacher. I've seen firsthand how difficult the job can be in normal times — let alone in the middle of a pandemic. So when I heard Beth's story, I knew @BarackObama and I had to give her a call.  https://t.co/xBdeItoMW6
Donald Trump's instinct to constantly add fuel to the fire is the last thing our country needs right now.  We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature.  https://t.co/tNUQUYDO8P
We need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first.
Folks, I'm excited to share that Senator @ewarren and I are hosting a grassroots fundraiser this Friday — and you're invited.

Donald Trump has shown that he can’t beat the pandemic or turn the economy around. And he is unsurprisingly stoking the flames of division for political gain.  He is the worst possible person to lead our nation through this moment.  https://t.co/CfJzEwU6Cm

Congratulations to California Child Care Providers United on a successful election. As president, I'll make it easier for child care workers to unionize — and I’ll provide resources so they earn higher wages while also making care more affordable. #ChildCareIsEssential
We need an effective, coordinated nationwide testing and tracing program. We need more PPE for health care workers. We need a comprehensive plan to get this virus under control.  We need this president to do his job.
I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.  There is nothing we're unable to achieve when we do it together.
Listen to the scientists: Wear a mask.  https://t.co/9CFioW4wvS
Donald Trump voted by mail. You should be able to as well.
Small business ownership is one of our country's cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. But Black and Brown entrepreneurs face far too many barriers to ownership, growth, and success.  I've got a plan to change that:  https://t.co/27Y38un2tM  https://t.co/MF7OpMS7bA
America has never lived up to our founding promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do. My new plan will advance racial equity across the American economy and bring us closer to reaching our highest ideals:  https://t.co/27Y38u5rCe  https://t.co/pQGZ78PXwC
My housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse President Trump’s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement.  We're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many Americans of color.
To support more Black and Brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new Small Business Opportunity Initiative. We're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code.
In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back.  We have to break the cycle, and I’ve got a plan to do it:  https://t.co/27Y38un2tM
This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It’s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people’s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome.
A change of “tone” over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.  Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects.
The Senate and this President should pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act — renamed yesterday in memory of John Lewis.  If they don’t, it will be one of the first things I do as president.
I'm in Wilmington, Delaware, to unveil the fourth plank of my Build Back Better plan. Tune in as I discuss what my administration will do to advance racial equity in our economy:  https://t.co/NTZviQqUX5

As Hurricane Hanna makes landfall, Jill and I are sending our prayers to the people of South Texas. We must ensure that affected residents get the support they need — and get it quickly. If you are in an impacted region, please heed the advice of local officials and seek shelter.
I know firsthand how hard it can be to take care of an aging family member. It's why as president, I'll ease the financial burden on families and expand access to dignified care for older Americans.  https://t.co/Z8FOorRgLe
No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. We have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and build an inclusive middle class that brings everyone along.
There is no quit in America — and you deserve a president who won’t quit on you.
President Trump ordered his administration to slow down coronavirus testing, he tried to block CDC funding, and he has ignored the experts from day one. His actions defy both logic and humanity.   What kind of president actively undercuts efforts that will save lives?

The President has a duty to care for us all. To see people where they are and to understand what they’re going through.  I’ve been a single parent. Even though I had a lot more support than a lot of folks going through tough times, I know how hard it is.  https://t.co/7JlGjvUcqd
This is the United States of America. We don’t settle — we aspire.  Let’s get to work.
The hard truth is that we can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.  President @BarackObama and I discussed how we can do that, and much more:  https://t.co/DBqIS5IoN3

The goal of the Census is clear: count every person. But Donald Trump continues to use this vital process to sow division and scare immigrant communities.  We won't let him deny communities the funding and representation they deserve. Because in America, everyone counts.

Home health workers do God’s work, but aren’t paid much. They have few benefits, and 40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid. It's unacceptable.  I'll give caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise.
We need to make high-quality child care affordable and accessible. As president, I'll give every 3- and 4-year-old access to free, high-quality preschool. And low- to middle-income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on quality care for children under age 5.
We are trapped in a caregiving crisis, within an economic crisis, within a public health crisis. You’re doing everything you can, but this president is not.  If I’m your president, here’s what I would do:  https://t.co/RbUFxJldQq
Donald Trump simply doesn’t understand: We can’t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.   And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest.

Eleven. That's how many times we've broken the single-day record for new COVID-19 cases in the last month.  This virus isn't going to "just disappear" like President Trump wants. It's surging — and we need real leadership from this White House to slow its spread.
I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t Donald Trump?  We deserve to know what this president is hiding.

President Obama and I left a playbook for President Trump on how to fight pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're all paying the price every day.

President Trump needs to do everything in his power to surge nationwide testing — including developing and evaluating more accurate, affordable, accessible, faster tests so we can reopen safely.  Infection rates are rising at an alarming pace. Mr. President, act now.
Mr. President, “Open everything now,” isn’t a strategy for success. It’s barely a slogan.   It’s long past time for you to step up and do your job.

America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future. My administration will invest $300 billion in research and development over four years to secure our global leadership and create millions of good-paying jobs.  https://t.co/xx2oLJ8VEt
"We're leading the world."  https://t.co/QQzaQeKAUj
Donald Trump needs to spend less time playing golf and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci.
In January, I sounded the alarm regarding COVID-19.   Over five months later, President Trump still hasn't taken the action needed to respond to the virus. It's unacceptable.  This president has failed the American people every step of the way.  https://t.co/PH4vF5KLuI
The stakes couldn't be higher this November. Time and time again, Donald Trump has failed the people of Puerto Rico.  As President, I'll spur economic development on the island and expand access to health care.
Together, we're going to build a new American economy:  https://t.co/RvfzbDN7dP  https://t.co/5TePAe7tbY
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I'll actually listen to the experts and heed their advice. Not silence them.
Mohamed Amashah is finally home after 486 days in Egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. Arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like Sarah Hegazy and Mohamed Soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. No more blank checks for Trump’s "favorite dictator."
Ignore the polls.  We’ve got work to do:  https://t.co/GCxsKwFY4h
Health care is personal to me. And as president, I'll do everything I can to make sure every American has access to the care they need.  https://t.co/Rmwsmx54KW
We need a president who will always choose to unite rather than divide, because there’s nothing we can’t accomplish when we do it together.
To all the nurses on the frontlines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes.  https://t.co/fgTDhXU72C
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.  We need real leadership, right now. Lives are at stake.
Back in January, when President Trump signed his hollow "phase one" trade deal with Beijing, I made clear that no one should be fooled by Trump's empty promises to deliver a meaningful “phase two" deal.  Good to see that he's finally admitting I was right.  https://t.co/Us8t3Z0KfA
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history. Every day that he remains in office, he further threatens the future of our democracy.  We have to vote him out this November.
I have no illusion about how tough the road ahead is. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.  Given a chance, ordinary Americans can do extraordinary things.  https://t.co/448jA7xlY3
This was almost two months ago.   Since then? Tens of thousands more lives lost. A million and a half new cases.  The President? Still golfing.  https://t.co/rHvIX80tLA
The United States has over 3 million cases of COVID-19, and over 130,000 people have died — yet Donald Trump continues to say it will just "fade away." It’s unbelievable.  We're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day.
I see a different America than President Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity, and justice.  I know we can reach our highest ideals — together.
Still true.

Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you’ve been knocked down. Respect for hard work, and for the people who do it.   Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton — and they're the values I’ll take to the Oval Office.
This is what “America First” looks like under President Trump:  https://t.co/jSmJOeG13G
Through every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger — and we will again.
Let’s use this opportunity to make bold investments in American industry and innovation so the future is made in America — and in all of America.   https://t.co/uTI6Gydi1n  https://t.co/8F8Uj2a3BI
Here's my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected president, I will take care of your family like I would my own.  https://t.co/vYmVUdMLO7
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
We can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.
This is our moment to imagine and build a new American economy — one where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.  https://t.co/BPUISe4Fd6
I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past.   American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now.
We can't just focus on the jobs of today — we have to also focus on the jobs and industries of tomorrow. I'll make a historic $300 billion investment in research and development that will spur innovation and help create 3 million jobs across the nation.  https://t.co/o29BPuYSlb
American workers can out-compete anyone, but they need a government that fights for them. I'll revitalize American manufacturing — especially smaller manufacturers and those owned by women and people of color — and ensure the future is made here in America.  https://t.co/lJQBsnRN75
When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy American products &amp; support American jobs.  But under Trump, the rate of federal contractors offshoring jobs more than doubled. It's unacceptable.  I'll invest $400 billion in American-made products &amp; keep jobs here at home.  https://t.co/iNpPuMzFqC
I'm in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, to discuss my plan to create jobs, raise wages, and help America build back better. Tune in to watch:  https://t.co/fSHMWax1u6
We're in the middle of an economic crisis. But it's not enough to just turn things around — we have to build back better. We have to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made in America — by all of America.  Here's how we'll do it:  https://t.co/lPgZPDPC98  https://t.co/ZjJ3pKiLrK
The future must be made in America — by all of America. Here's how we'll do it:  https://t.co/lPgZPE7d0G  https://t.co/KERhYFcXAY
As I was saying.
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We need a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.
I commend the Task Forces for their service and for helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country. And I am deeply grateful to @BernieSanders for working with us to unite our party and deliver real, lasting change for generations to come.
Increased testing isn’t the reason for the surge in coronavirus cases — Donald Trump's failed leadership is.  https://t.co/j7vKxnlaj4
Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.  He's spread racism against our Latino community ever since.  We need to work in partnership with Mexico.  We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.  That's what I'll do as President.
Let me be clear: No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic because they can’t pay rent.  https://t.co/0NJ9ao7HON
When there were 15 cases, the President said it wouldn't spread any farther.   We just hit our 3 millionth case.  We're paying for his failure.  https://t.co/gYwTWZyYOs
.@AdyBarkan — The courage you show every day is an inspiration to so many, and I'm grateful to have you by my side in this fight. We may not agree on everything, but this we do: Health care is a right — not a privilege. And we're going to make that a reality, together.
This is a national disgrace. We have to ensure these communities get the care they need immediately — and then tackle racial disparities in health care and our economy head-on.
The most sacred obligation of our government is to keep our troops safe when we send them into battle — and to care for them when they come home. We need a president who will honor that obligation.  https://t.co/UMrDVwHaD3
Across the world, people come to this country with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future. They study here, innovate here, they make America who we are. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health. On my first day as President, I will rejoin the @WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage.
We've seen what happens when the federal government fails to secure sufficient supplies of critical products like PPE — and we can't let it happen again. So today, I'm releasing my plan to rebuild U.S. supply chains:  https://t.co/5RXYqQcqmn
Donald Trump needs to do his job.
Character belongs in the White House.  https://t.co/Bz1syMprhJ
To beat COVID-19, we need a coordinated national response from the federal government — but Donald Trump refuses to do his job. I've laid out exactly what I would do, and I encourage this president to adopt the plan in its entirety:  https://t.co/SOVOPL7uPy
There’s enormous opportunity once we defeat Donald Trump. We are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than they've ever been before.
The nation is crying out for leadership — leadership that can unite us and bring us together. But this president has nothing to offer.  https://t.co/rzV0GdOqHN
With COVID-19 surging across the nation, Donald Trump should be doing everything in his power to increase access to testing. Instead, he's doing the opposite. It's despicable.
It didn't have to be this bad. But Donald Trump failed to do his job — and we're all paying the price.  https://t.co/OXONhAWNqy
We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump.  https://t.co/12yF31aLSz
We're going to beat Donald Trump. And when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation — we'll transform it.
There are so many unsung heroes in our communities, especially in times of crisis. We owe Alassane and countless others a debt of gratitude — and I'll fight for them every day in the White House.  https://t.co/tUwZYpeoNW
On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. It’s time for free and fair elections so that the Venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime.
COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped.
Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he’s wrong — on both fronts.  We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises.
The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad, but Donald Trump ignored the warnings and refused to take action. He failed our nation.  https://t.co/AcY62E8L2L

The health care workers on the frontlines of this fight are some of the greatest heroes our nation has ever seen.  https://t.co/Ry6TvJcbuU
America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all — and it's long past time we lived up to it.
American history isn’t a fairytale. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. But it’s a battle we can and will win — together.
This Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask.
Our nation was founded on a simple idea: We're all created equal. We've never lived up to it — but we've never stopped trying. This Independence Day, let's not just celebrate those words, let's commit to finally fulfill them. Happy #FourthOfJuly!  https://t.co/1WrATlx8Xl

It didn't have to be this bad. But month after month, as other leaders in other countries took the necessary steps to get the virus under control, Donald Trump failed us.  Here's what I'll do as president:  https://t.co/xsCrfzWnxC
It’s abundantly clear that this virus isn’t going to just “fade away,” Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up, take action, and lead.
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose science over fiction.
Donald Trump styled himself as a wartime president. But now it seems this president has surrendered. He has waved the white flag and left the field of battle when we need him most. It's unacceptable.  We need real leadership. Right now.  https://t.co/2T3WbFLYV3
We are five months into this crisis, and our health care workers still don't have the masks and protective equipment they need. It's a national disgrace.  Mr. President, use your authority and fix the shortage of PPE before you tee off for yet another round of golf.
Donald Trump has called himself a "cheerleader" for the nation. But we don't need a cheerleader — we need a President. One who will:  - Lead by example - Take responsibility - Tell the unvarnished truth - Listen to the experts and follow the science
Wear a mask.  https://t.co/HBDMNA4ary
Let me be clear: There’s no victory to be celebrated when we’re still down nearly 15 million jobs and the pandemic is getting worse, not better.
This is a job Donald Trump is entirely unfit for.  https://t.co/7vipLgLCiU
“Mr. President, it's too much.”  https://t.co/WEebjiPKgj
This is a shameful move. Now is the time for employers to have empathy for families juggling work and caregiving.  It's long past time for President Trump to show some leadership so we can get this virus under control.

I’ll read my daily briefings.
Small businesses are the backbone of communities across our nation, and we need to do so much more to help them. Donald Trump may have forgotten about them — but I never will.  https://t.co/RDYKzt1Qc1
If the reports are true, Donald Trump either read his briefings about the Russian bounties and did nothing — or he didn't read them at all. Either way, it's an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.  The American people deserve answers.  https://t.co/LuDqIUrjhP
On day one, I’ll get right to work tackling COVID-19. I'll bring together our nation's top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.  We are all in this together — and we've got to fight this together.  https://t.co/7An2MOGiiF
We need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period.  It’s not just about you — it’s about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It’s about keeping other people safe.
This is my promise to you: When I am President, I will take care of your health care coverage and your family the same way I would my own.  https://t.co/Ahq3vZHT5l
As #ImmigrantHeritageMonth comes to a close, I want to make one thing clear: Immigrants have always made our nation stronger — our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength.  Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does.
Folks, we’re just a few hours away from our end-of-quarter deadline, and we need your help to hit our goal. Every donation — big or small — goes a long way to helping us catch up to Donald Trump.  If you can, please chip in today:  https://t.co/18tN9TNYtX
On the final day of #PrideMonth, here’s my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected, I will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
We’re facing a serious threat — and we need to meet it together as one country. But this President gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another.  We can't continue on like this.  https://t.co/LA8OJ86Nnk
If I’m elected, I’ll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country.   I’ll have the nation’s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one — and I'll actually listen to them.
Mr. President, the American people didn’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.  Step up. Take responsibility. Do your job.
Tune in as I deliver remarks on how President Trump failed to protect the American people, save our economy, and control the virus:  https://t.co/pqbJECpUHQ
I want every single American to know: if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day — I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.  We are going to get through this — together.
As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself.
Folks, tomorrow night marks our first end-of-quarter deadline of the general election. We need your help to hit our goal so we can catch up to Donald Trump's hefty cash-on-hand advantage.   I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/mv8ZZdhwAI

Here’s my promise to you: I’ll appoint a director who will actually go after financial predators and protect consumers.
Today's decision reaffirmed that states can't put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions—but the fight isn't over. As President, I'll codify Roe v. Wade and protect a woman’s constitutional right to choose.   https://t.co/qFrH8hFst8
It's time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity and respect, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.  We are everything that Donald Trump is not.
William Perry Pendley spent his career fighting to sell off public lands — and to allow drilling, mining, and logging on them with hardly any oversight.   Now the President has nominated him to oversee them at @BLMNational. Consider me opposed.
White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history — not promoted by the President of the United States.
The arc of the moral universe bent a little bit more today.
Obamacare was and is a big deal. We can't let Donald Trump tear it down — we have to protect and build on it.  https://t.co/P9QZvidZmD

Donald Trump's entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale. It’s a betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation, to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way.  https://t.co/r6DCWowxc4
Today the President shared a video of people shouting “white power” and said they were “great.” Just like he did after Charlottesville.   We’re in a battle for the soul of the nation — and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: it’s a battle we will win.
Children should be released from ICE detention with their parents immediately. This is pretty simple, and I can't believe I have to say it: Families belong together.  https://t.co/11F5X71AO1

I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish.

Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would "fade away."  Now, we're facing a record-high number of new cases, and it's surging across the country.  Trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action — and we're all paying the price.
In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to root out systemic racism and close the racial wealth and income gaps. We can do it, together.  https://t.co/l6AmXzfDDB
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a global pandemic.
DC should be a state. Pass it on.
The American people have sacrificed so much to fight this virus — we've lost lives, businesses, paychecks. And now, we're losing the progress we've made because this president refuses to do his job.  Donald Trump has failed our nation every step of the way.
While President Trump continues his victory lap, over 20 million Americans remain out of work. He may have forgotten about you, but I never will — and I'll fight for you every single day in the White House.
While the Trump Administration continues their efforts to rip health care away from millions, I'm speaking about how we can make quality, affordable health care available to every American.  Tune in:  https://t.co/CJ8KWt4Z2M
Health care workers are selflessly risking their lives every day on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 — and hundreds have paid the ultimate price.  They are American heroes — and we cannot forget the sacrifices they made to care for us all.  https://t.co/JBlSo0mYdb
Democracy is under threat globally. Restoring the soul of America means fixing democracy at home, and confronting — not cozying up to — dictators around the world. When I'm president, America will defend democracy at home and abroad.  https://t.co/3L6gqvXgI7
Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.
This virus is not just going to disappear because you want it to, Mr. President.  Listen to the experts. Take clear, concrete action. Do your job.

Workers called back on the job deserve access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing.
Instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking Americans get through this crisis, Republicans are jamming through another one of Trump’s unqualified nominees. It's wrong.  Cory Wilson lacks judicial temperament and experience—and has no place on a Federal Court.
We need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care — not rip it away.
To everyone who is scared, hurting, and wondering what's going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I hear you. And I'll fight for you every single day in the White House.  https://t.co/UDQiuTX69L
Our planet cannot take four more years of Donald Trump.  https://t.co/0Wrl9URSxF
The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There’s not a single thing we can't do if we do it together.
It's clear Donald Trump will stop at nothing to tear down Obamacare and rip health care away from millions. We cannot let him get away with it. We have to build on the ACA with a new public option to ensure everyone receives the care they deserve.  https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
It's pretty simple: If we want to save people's jobs and save people's lives, we need more testing — and we need it faster. The President is intentionally slowing it down.
This is yet another attempt to distract from this Administration's failure to lead an effective response to COVID-19. Immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. The President can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis.
It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.  He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation.
To Ashley, and all the health care workers on the front lines of this fight, thank you. You are American heroes.  https://t.co/B6UCR5xmhc

We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.  We can't stand by and let that happen.

Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolas Maduro.   As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy.
Trump opposed sanctioning China’s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.  Where Trump has been weak, I will be strong, clear, and consistent in standing up for America's values and its people.

Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains:  https://t.co/bEPmsRgZDo
Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.  Unbelievable.
The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.  It’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921.  https://t.co/wYX3Adq3vN
Christian Cooper’s encounter in Central Park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. I'm grateful for Christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done.  https://t.co/XWhcTjbo0t
We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:  - Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs - Stands in the way of the CDC - Refuses to wear a mask  He is failing even the most basic test of leadership.
I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.  None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.
Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake.  That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election:  https://t.co/gGeSmBIIxA
On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, TX, the last enslaved African Americans were finally given notice of their freedom. 155 years later, we're still on the long road to equality, equity, and fairness for all.

#Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all.
Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump.
Climate change is linked to increased pregnancy risks — and heartbreakingly, Black mothers are being hit the hardest. As President, I'll work every day to tackle the climate crisis head-on and root out injustice. Because they are intertwined.
To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you. #HomeIsHere  https://t.co/VZPVqY1cgq
The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court — and the generational impact its justices can have.  We have the power to shape the Court's future this November — and we can’t forget that.
I'm ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready?  https://t.co/ksgxTsG7QK
Dreamers are Americans. Period.
Just like Donald Trump couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April — he can’t ignore it away in June.  https://t.co/nOBnrL4rWi
Here’s my promise to you: On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue.
It didn’t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.  We need a president who will put the American people first — and actually do the work.
Thanks, Barack. You're right — and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country.
Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it.  https://t.co/kxBBzhxvxc
The Supreme Court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. And as President, I will get to work immediately to make it permanent.  https://t.co/xKkCp4P9Ff
Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.  Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.
Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.  That's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.  It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President.  https://t.co/9h08nxjC6k
I’m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today’s #WorkersFirst Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the #HeroesAct now and take action to root out systemic racism.
If John Bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values.
Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it — and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.  This president has failed to lead our nation.
Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world — killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind.  https://t.co/zpVG2ak8aK
I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in:  https://t.co/VaCPc32w9A
The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.  It has to change.
We need a president who chooses unity over division.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history.
We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.  Let’s do it together.
We can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.
Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement — and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward:  https://t.co/mVkxpWxbod
This virus won’t just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up and do your job.
Los Dreamers son estadounidenses. Trump les quitó la protección que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. Esto es inaceptable. El primer día de mi presidencia enviaré un proyecto de ley al Congreso que protegerá a los beneficiarios de DACA de la deportación.  https://t.co/mGmTA03HEq
LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. Period.
Folks, I’ve got some big news: Next week, I’m getting together with my friend and former boss, President @BarackObama, for a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We would love to see you there.   Chip in now to get your ticket:  https://t.co/UD3RHHKIw1
Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It’s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress.  https://t.co/YlvFuCaTrZ
I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.   It's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the American ideal finally wins out.  https://t.co/iUyi82zXN7
I'm grateful for @PPact's support and proud to stand with them in this fight. As president, I’m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care — including reproductive health care.
Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response.  https://t.co/IUdWpqZncn
Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.  Here’s what I would do as president:  https://t.co/Ni1rAm8DNZ
Today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect. But we're not done.  https://t.co/Bz4SMA9tgb
After reports of wealthy Trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the PPP money went. It's unacceptable.  The American people deserve answers.  https://t.co/F2n3PA7RZU
In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.  Together, we’re going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all.
We need a president who heals — not one who fans the flames of hate.   We need a president who unites — not one who sows further discord for political gain.   We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand — not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.
We’re facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation’s history — and it’s clear Donald Trump isn’t up for the job.  We need real leadership, right now.
We have to ensure every worker called back on the job has access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing and effective personal protective equipment.  https://t.co/lDPQP3jZkw
We need a president who will fight to further LGBTQ+ equality — not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.
We need real policing reform — and we need it now.  https://t.co/HkBvD8QsmL
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can't go back to the way things were before — we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.  We can do it, together.
Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation — not use them for political gain.  We shouldn’t accept anything less from an American president.  https://t.co/I0r60NW4SU
We need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.   We can’t let that happen.
In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period.  https://t.co/nr1u0vOvog
On the fourth anniversary of Pulse. In the middle of Pride month. During a global pandemic.  Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November.
Two years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. Photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy.
Medgar Evers once said, "freedom has never been free." On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today.
Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub. As we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities — we have to double down on our efforts to #HonorThemWithAction.  https://t.co/TKaZ4M7IFF
We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:  - Outlaw chokeholds - Improve oversight and accountability - Create a model use of force standard - Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces
Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn’t forget about us.   The President couldn’t wish away the virus in April, he couldn’t tweet it away in May, and he can’t ignore it away in June.
Our country is crying out for leadership that Donald Trump can’t deliver.  https://t.co/QHvUdgg6Io
We need a president who chooses hope over fear.
We can't let history repeat itself — Facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. Watch my deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it:  https://t.co/WYMMAWkuLZ  https://t.co/OGG2wwtW2P
COVID-19 can affect anyone, anywhere — but it doesn't impact every community equally. Watch as Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton explains how it’s impacting communities of color:  https://t.co/3uuXEsfyv4
While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.   He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country — and hardworking Americans are paying the price.
We have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong — and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen:  https://t.co/v6hImc0J3q
We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen:  https://t.co/7WIbtob6WE

With less than 150 days until Election Day, the stakes couldn't be higher. We've got to fix Facebook to protect our democracy and ensure fair elections.   If you agree, sign the open letter today to demand Facebook take action. #MoveFastFixIt  https://t.co/6Hmta4UxS9
So far, Facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. Time is running out.   Today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies:  https://t.co/S1WIQTsfEL
Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.   We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.
It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress — and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.
There is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do — and we have to do the hard work to end it.  https://t.co/w9H77Jbuqa
We have to make this an era of action — starting with real police reform. No more excuses. No more delays.   Add your name to demand Congress ban chokeholds — and pass real police reform — right now:  https://t.co/Sa6sPy2BtS
This pandemic isn't just going to go away because you want it to, Mr. President. Step up and do your job before your negligence costs even more lives than it already has.  https://t.co/L6QfV31eFQ

Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years.    But I’m ready to get to work on day one. We can’t accept anything less from an American president.
Donald Trump’s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country—but just fixing the way the president talks won’t cut it. We need to root out systemic racism and ensure Black Americans have a real shot to get ahead.  https://t.co/FhgRNPjKR8
America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do.
From ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines — what happened today in Georgia should enrage us all. We need to act now to prevent it from happening again in November. Our democracy depends on it.
Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:   - More than 110,000 people have died - We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19 - Over 20 million Americans are out of work   And yet he’s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable.
Small businesses like Rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. We have to do so much more to help them through this crisis.  https://t.co/msi1oZ6P24

Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.   We need justice. We need action. We need reform.
Grief is a heavy burden to bear — and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose — to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.  That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service:  https://t.co/2LKJzwBUSO
My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.  Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.  I'm a Catholic – just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either.
13 million people who had jobs when you took office are unemployed today.

We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.   It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions.
American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward.  https://t.co/AbLAYAUsZx
These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps.  https://t.co/KforFaypAP
We need to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth.  https://t.co/NANxlpk538
This isn’t about politics. This is about the future of our country. Grateful for your support, Secretary Powell.
The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.   We cannot give him another four years in the White House.
We need to stand up as a nation — with the Black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.   It is the duty of every American to grapple with it — and grapple with it now.
I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.   We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.
To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won’t ever forget you. And I won’t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you.  https://t.co/YxQ2OaeSyQ
Today, we honor those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay
Today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause.   No one can stay silent.  https://t.co/nZjQdJGKbD
We're just 150 days out from Election Day, and the stakes have never been higher. We have to defeat Donald Trump, and once we do, we won’t just rebuild this country — we'll transform it. Together.   Help us make it happen:  https://t.co/AflPBScS1L

This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.  The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop.

Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it:  https://t.co/eD9z51pXDQ
Let’s be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God — but to the failure of a President.
George Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.  For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable.
Tune in as I speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy:  https://t.co/pfELb1jmqa
Those who have worked the closest with Donald Trump know how unfit he is to serve as President.
It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.   We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.   We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.
We can’t take four more years of this.
To everyone struggling with mental health—you're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.   Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma.  https://t.co/QXplsIwYTL
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists.

Jim Mattis and I haven’t always agreed on everything, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more powerful indictment of Trump's actions and character than the one he's written.  "We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose."
I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.  It's up to all of us to create the America we know we can be.  https://t.co/LNI2e3d3lz
More than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest.  https://t.co/qXnKEf1JMF

The nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.
Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.  I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be?  https://t.co/taSpWIFT1b
We need a president who listens.  https://t.co/aBdClOSDYw
It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress — and we have that chance once again. We’re not just going to rebuild this nation — we’re going to transform it.   There is nothing we can’t do if we do it together.  https://t.co/iozMdaLtAw
If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be.
I ask all of America — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.
If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.  No more excuses. No more delays.
When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.  When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.  Donald Trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself.
The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won’t either.  But I promise you this: I won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain.  https://t.co/TfNaoMRZQp
That’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us.  https://t.co/rWHywb5cHV
“I can’t breathe.”   George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation.   It’s a wake-up call for all of us.  https://t.co/q6kARnpJqU
Julián — I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on — and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support.
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.  Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important—who we want to be. It’s all at stake.   That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward.
The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something:   That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves.   That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America.
A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time.
Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in:  https://t.co/1bSdeXp8Rc

He's using the American military against the American people.  He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  For a photo.  For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together.
In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.   We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.   We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.
Leaders listen.  https://t.co/FPSJP4Fkn3

We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other.  https://t.co/Y224rANwUF
Trump’s Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from @WHO during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19.
If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.  None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out.
You can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back.  We all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable.  https://t.co/vES2aIXVGl
Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel.  https://t.co/AskxceOJJU
Every day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president.  https://t.co/Fq90hSLuLz
This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.  This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now.
We are a country with an open wound.  None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words — “I can’t breathe” — and do nothing.  We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.  https://t.co/veodlR1UYU
It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.  It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.  We need justice for George Floyd.
Tune in as I address the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the killing of George Floyd:  https://t.co/AKk14gGif5
I will be speaking more about the events in Minnesota later today.
I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too.
This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.
Enough.
We can’t allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation.
We’re months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.   I do:  https://t.co/MTnecpzZgv
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and we’re seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope.  https://t.co/hK8AbPKZue
100,000+ lives lost across the country. 1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases. 40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.  Donald Trump has failed our nation.
Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure of leadership.  https://t.co/YSHGLBdMLG
Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities:  https://t.co/psuNvKzYej
The hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.

.@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. His outspokenness raised our consciousness on HIV/AIDS and saved countless lives.
There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.  To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you.  https://t.co/SBBRKV4mPZ
Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.  Read more from @TammyforIL and me:  https://t.co/W7h54A91U9
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.  It’s morally reprehensible.

Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.  Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.  I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November.
George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.  I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation.
Wear a mask.
Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.  We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy.
The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these. But we’re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.  If you can, please chip in today:  https://t.co/af28OgWn2G
1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.

So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look:  https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
There’s not a single thing the American people can’t do if we do it together.
We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities — and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come.
This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box.
To all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget. #MemorialDay  https://t.co/b5vDrYiPL5
The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.
Hunger today isn’t about scarcity — it’s about a massive failure in leadership.   If I were President, I’d immediately work with @chefjoseandres to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis.  https://t.co/dGqSDgqXpM

As Ramadan draws to an end, @DrBiden and I want to wish a safe and warm celebration to our Muslim friends and neighbors. Even though we can't be all together to celebrate, we hope it is filled with joy, family, and success for the year to come. #EidMubarak
This is jarring — and a heartbreaking reminder that the death toll we see in the news is so much more than just a statistic. Every single one marks a future cut short and a family and community that will never be the same. @DrBiden and I are keeping them all in our hearts.
Donald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. It’s unacceptable.  I’ll make meaningful investments in Indian Country — including increasing funding for Indian Health Services and making that funding mandatory.  https://t.co/JIObym7aXI

We can protect the sacred right to vote and protect public health at the same time.
The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  It’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
36,000 Americans could be alive today if President Trump had acted sooner. Let's put that into perspective:  https://t.co/i2bmqRe86r
We're in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetime, and Senate Republicans continue to delay relief for the American people saying, "I don’t see the need right now." Unbelievable.  We've got to take back the Senate this November.  https://t.co/ij73z7Oq9P

Donald Trump is using a global health crisis as an excuse to deport children and continue separating families. It's heartless and un-American. People across the political spectrum rejected these policies before, and will do so again, because they know families belong together.

Donald Trump has failed to provide for our nurses and doctors on the frontlines. Now he’s short-changing our troops and their families. Unacceptable.
Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide.
When we emerge from this crisis, we can’t just go back to the way things were before. We need to take this country to a place we’ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream.
Congratulations to Dr. @iingwen on the start of her second term. Taiwan’s thriving democracy and response to COVID-19 are an example to the world. America’s support for Taiwan must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan.
The United States of America has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation — and we will again. We will overcome this.
Fundamentally, this is about whose side the government is on and whether it is accountable to the American people. This is a case I will continue to make, and if elected president will deliver on.  https://t.co/x19ZeMOz4v
That's exactly why @EWarren and I have called for more oversight. We need more conditions on corporations to ensure relief goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No $500 billion slush fund. No blank checks. The Trump Administration is prioritizing big corporations over workers.
During today’s Senate Banking Committee hearing, Secretary @StevenMnuchin1 refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in CARES Act funds to keep workers on their payrolls. @EWarren asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused.

It’s time we reward the people who actually make this country work. Not Wall Street CEOs — but the middle class. Ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.  That's who I'll fight for every single day in the White House.
Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus. But he does bear full responsibility for failing to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.
With your help, we'll defeat Donald Trump. And we won't just rebuild this nation — we’ll transform it. I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today to help make it happen:  https://t.co/Wje8LYRL0J
One of President Trump's top advisors admitted that this administration "really let the country down" on testing.  He's right. It's long past time for Trump to step up and implement a national testing strategy so we can begin safely reopening the economy.  https://t.co/jDawbgdAzl
- Expand vote-by-mail and early voting - Implement online voter registration - Ensure everyone can safely vote in-person  We need to do everything in our power to ensure every American can safely make their voice heard this November.
Companies getting relief from taxpayers have an obligation to protect workers' paychecks, and the Trump Administration has an obligation to hold their feet to the fire to ensure they do.  We need real relief paired with real oversight—not no-strings-attached corporate bailouts.
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history — and his recovery efforts are making that clearer than ever.
In the middle of the worst public health crisis in our lifetime, President Trump is actively trying to terminate health insurance for millions of Americans. It's unthinkable.  Here's what I would do to ensure everyone has access to the coverage they need:  https://t.co/7kvok6B6if
In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. It's who we are. And it's how we're going to get through this — together.
A year ago today, the House passed the #EqualityAct, a long-overdue bill that would ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated with dignity and respect under the law. But @SenateMajLdr won't bring it up for a vote. It's unacceptable.  Passing it will be a top legislative priority of mine.
I'm incredibly grateful for everyone who has chipped in to help fuel this campaign — especially in times as tough as these. @EWarren and I called a few folks to thank them for their support:  https://t.co/FPpttl2wkc
As we reflect on the incredible legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, we’re reminded of the urgent work that remains before us 66 years later. We can’t rest until every kid gets a fair shot, and we finally live up to our founding ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all.
Moments of crisis require presidents to step up, transcend partisan politics, and unite the nation to achieve a common goal. But Donald Trump has done nothing but stoke division—and we're seeing the effect every day. He is the worst possible person to lead us through this crisis.
No graduating class gets to choose the world into which they graduate, but few have ever entered at a point in this country's history where they genuinely have a chance to write a new chapter.  Congratulations to the class of 2020, I can't wait to see the future you create.  https://t.co/rfdhDJzBjO

Los fracasos internacionales de Trump han abierto el camino para que Cuba se una al Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Esto traiciona a los presos políticos en Cuba y mina aún más la diplomacia de los EE.UU. Como presidente, defenderé los derechos humanos del pueblo cubano.
Trump's international failures have cleared a path for Cuba to join the UN Human Rights Council. This would betray Cuba's political prisoners and further undermine U.S. diplomacy. As President, I will lead by empowering the Cuban people and defending human rights.
To everyone who has lost a loved one due to COVID-19: I know it's incredibly difficult right now, but there will come a time when their memory brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye.

Not only does the Trump Administration want to take away health coverage for millions in the middle of a pandemic, but now they want to let people go hungry, too. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds.  https://t.co/12JpuMOXEH
Moments of crisis require swift and decisive action from our leaders, but Donald Trump and his administration have done nothing but dither and delay. They have failed the American people on every single front.
I would trust the guy who’s one of our nation's top public health experts, not the one who pondered injecting disinfectant into the body and looked directly at a solar eclipse.
Enough with the anger and division and fear-mongering, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up, appeal to our better angels, and unite the country. We'll overcome this crisis by coming together — not by tearing each other apart.
It didn’t have to be this bad. Donald Trump utterly failed to prepare for this pandemic and delayed in taking the necessary steps to safeguard our nation against the near-worst-case-economic scenario we are now living.  https://t.co/oFOuf4GbeB

The Trump Administration clearly knows what's needed to make workplaces safe and operational: adequate testing, contact tracing, masks, and additional precautions.  They're putting in the work to keep themselves safe. Why aren't they doing the same for the American people?

There’s no quit in America. None at all. We’re going to get through this — and we're going to come out stronger.

We need to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along.  We have to make sure every single person gets a fair shot at success.

Make no mistake: COVID-19 has caused a massive economic challenge. But this crisis hit us harder, and will last longer, because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength.  https://t.co/4nkrpNDXgs
Two years ago, Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran Deal. This week, he vetoed a war powers resolution that would've prevented him from starting a war with Iran without Congressional consent. His decisions have increased the risk of war in the Middle East.  https://t.co/Tq0CU99A1r
Corruption is a feature of Donald Trump's economic agenda—not a bug. He will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.  I say it’s time we pick a different way—one where everyone gets a fair shot at success, not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.  https://t.co/9MbZpSblC5
75 years ago on #VEDay, America and its allies defeated fascism in Europe. From the devastation of war, we built a lasting peace. Today, as we honor the veterans who sacrificed for us, let us remember the importance of uniting against common threats.
It didn’t have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump was simply not up to the job.

Every step of the way, President Trump has ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day.  I promise you, I will do the opposite.

You heard it straight from the president himself: He wants to terminate health care for millions of Americans in the middle of a global pandemic.  We can't let that happen.
The stakes in this election have never been higher. Over the last few months, we've seen how wholly unfit Donald Trump is to lead our nation.  We have to vote him out of the White House this November.

This didn't have to happen. The Trump Administration failed to take action and produce desperately needed protective equipment — and those on the front lines of this crisis paid the price. It's heartbreaking.  https://t.co/7bOj3POJCT
The Biden Administration will not silence scientists.
The choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. We have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy.

This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable — especially not in the White House.  https://t.co/Ga8zWYphOg
Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.
A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.

This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the nation and around the world — to solve this crisis.
When I say Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history, this is what I'm talking about.  Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it.
We left a playbook. He ignored it.  We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it.  We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out.  Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared.
Mi corazón y el de Jill están con Puerto Rico a raíz de los terremotos de hoy. Mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del COVID-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo más pronto posible.
My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible.
To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet.  To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.
On March 6th, Donald Trump said: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  It was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.  This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide.
When we come together and act as one America, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish.
No one should have to pay for coronavirus treatment. Period.  https://t.co/GBchrVZmDz
I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America. The president should encourage folks to follow Gov. Whitmer’s public health orders — not sow further discord and division.
As we mark the beginning of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, @DrBiden and I extend our best wishes to AANHPI communities across America. We look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead.
When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We have to build a better future for all.  We can and will transform this nation — together.
This crisis isn't about you, Mr. President. It's about the American people.  https://t.co/3a4ppJ964Y
We have lived long enough with a President who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That’s not me. As a Presidential candidate, I’m accountable to the American people.  https://t.co/Wm1666LF8A
We need a president who listens.  https://t.co/pUFSMLd3pe
We need more tests. Our front line workers need protective equipment. Americans need additional economic relief.  Yet the Trump Administration is spending time and energy on President Trump's wasteful border wall.  Unbelievable.  https://t.co/RY12LJAYGS
The number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.  We have to do more to help them. Now.
- More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died - 30 million have filed for unemployment - At least 1 million have gotten sick  Enough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead.
Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April.  He was wrong. And we're all paying the price.  https://t.co/R0tDbI1WZr
An open and independent press is more important than ever in times like this. They deserve to be treated with respect — not belittled with schoolyard taunts from this president.
Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty.

The climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action to combat it before it's too late.
In the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is still working to gut the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.  They need to drop the lawsuit immediately.  https://t.co/yc6azeqLVs
With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions.

We owe a profound debt of gratitude to the health care workers on the front lines of this fight. I checked in with Monica, an ICU Nurse, to talk about how she's getting through this and to thank her for all she's doing:  https://t.co/PLuEZWO5aQ

There are nearly 330 million people in the United States — and according to the Trump White House, we've only conducted 5.4 million COVID-19 tests. It's abysmal.  Donald Trump needs to scale up testing, and he needs to do it immediately.
Let me be very clear: No one is expendable.  We shouldn’t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability.
The fact is there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. If we had listened to the experts and heeded their warnings, it could have been stopped short. But Donald Trump failed to act — and now the American people are paying the price.  https://t.co/oXeANYvD7T

Brien usually works at the Ford Plant in Rawsonville, Michigan, driving a semi. But when the plant started assembling much-needed ventilators, he courageously stepped up and volunteered to help. His selfless actions will no doubt save countless lives.

Our planet cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump.
We have the power to change the future of our planet — and it starts at the ballot box this November.  https://t.co/9COHq8TRZ8
This #EarthDay, let’s recommit to doing everything in our power to combat climate change. That starts with voting Donald Trump out of the White House this November.
@OfficialJLD Stranger things have happened.
Fifty years ago, #EarthDay began as a day of organizing that demonstrated the power of community action. This year, it’s also a reminder of everything that’s on the line if we do not get Donald Trump out of the White House.  https://t.co/IkZPE983fO
The climate emergency requires our urgent action. As president, I will:  - Ensure we achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050 - Rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to go further - Make the largest-ever investment in clean energy

Throughout my career, I've been committed to the fight against climate change. And on day one as president, I'll get to work taking the drastic action we need to address this crisis. #EarthDay  https://t.co/CTbTiwxI4Y
On #EarthDay, we're reminded that there is no more urgent crisis facing this nation, or the world, than the threat posed by climate change. We have to take drastic action before it’s too late — and that’s exactly what I will do as president.   https://t.co/FbsOsz7VzW  https://t.co/4KwlWtOibd
Folks, we just launched a special #EarthDay episode of Here's the Deal! Governor @JayInslee joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, climate change, and why he's supporting our campaign.  Listen to the full episode now:  https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo  https://t.co/DRJyrZ5njV
The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.  As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It’s unacceptable.  We can’t safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can’t effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job.
The Paycheck Protection Program was intended to send help to the small businesses that needed it most, but President Trump adopted an approach to help his high-priced friends. We've got to do better.  Here's what I would do if I were president:  https://t.co/NXMrGe56Pg
The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We need to immediately expand vote-by-mail, online voter registration, and early voting to ensure everyone can safely exercise their right to participate in our electoral process.  https://t.co/An7O2h1t9M
I know COVID-19 is causing many people to feel anxious about what the future holds or lonely during this time of social distancing — and that's okay, just know that you're not alone. I've asked my friend, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to share a few tips on how to get through this:  https://t.co/Hx9TMlF2zP
This Holocaust Remembrance Day, as we remember the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime, we recommit to ensuring such atrocities never again occur. With anti-Semitism on the rise, all of us must root out intolerance and give hate no safe harbor.
Out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated.
I am honored to have the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, a leading environmental advocacy organization. Climate change is an existential threat, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity facing our country and our world.
In March alone, this campaign raised $46.7 million, with 70% from online donations. This virus has changed our campaign. But it hasn't changed the unwavering support we've gotten from all of you. Together, we're going to defeat Trump. Help keep us going:  https://t.co/GIzEQS0nNj
The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job.

The office of the presidency comes with the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Every great president throughout our history has met that duty with the leadership it demands. Donald Trump has not.  https://t.co/Dn9Gj50Dev
Like many families, we have had to find new ways to stay connected while we're physically apart. We've been video chatting with our grandchildren a lot and decided to record one to share with you all. Take a look:  https://t.co/1pGtQGcDhj
On #SOULSaturday, folks will be doing everything from sewing masks and hosting food drives to writing letters to first responders and making calls to check in on neighbors. We are all in this together–and I hope you'll join us by signing up to take action:  https://t.co/rRADhp4Usl
In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. We lend a hand to our neighbors and take care of those in need. It's who we are. In that spirit, and to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting S.O.U.L. of the Nation Saturday this weekend.
We have to come together to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Once we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it and create a better future for all.
On this week’s episode of Here’s the Deal, Senator @AmyKlobuchar joins me for a discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted her family and what drove her to get involved in politics.  Listen to the full episode at:  https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc  https://t.co/YaLgMAQNff
At a time when Trump is fanning the flames of white supremacy and hatred in our country, my heart is with the families of those we lost in the Oklahoma City bombing 25 years ago today. We must never give up the fight against these forces of hate and intolerance.
Tune in to watch @SymoneDSanders and actor @TonyGoldwyn host a town hall on how COVID-19 has impacted workers in the entertainment industry:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50
.@DrBiden and I are keeping the loved ones of the more than 40,000 people in the U.S. we've lost due to COVID-19 in our prayers. This is a solemn day for our nation, and there will be more hard days ahead. But if we pull together, we will get through this. I promise.
Tonight, @SymoneDSanders and actor @TonyGoldwyn will be hosting a town hall focused on how COVID-19 is impacting workers in the entertainment industry.  Tune in at 7 PM ET to watch:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/VmSvAbIaon
To everyone working on the front lines of this crisis, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.  https://t.co/vr10U5pca6
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. We'll listen to the experts and heed their advice. And I will always tell you the truth.
At a time when studies are linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality rates for the most vulnerable in our society, the Trump Administration is rolling back environmental protections — allowing more poison into our air.  https://t.co/047lsdtrQN
As Kierkegaard said, “faith sees best in the dark.” I've always believed that. This pandemic is keeping many communities apart, but we've still got to keep the faith. Jill and I are wishing a Happy Easter to all of the Orthodox Christians celebrating around the world.
The United States should be standing up for freedom and standing with the people of Hong Kong. Instead, Trump has said he's “standing with Xi Jinping.” That's weak. We need to be strong on values when it comes to China. That's what I'll do as president.
I couldn't be prouder of my friends @LadyGaga and Chris Martin of @Coldplay for organizing the @GlblCtzn One World: #TogetherAtHome broadcast. We are all in this fight together — and if we stand as one, we will defeat COVID-19.
On Sunday night, @SymoneDSanders and actor @TonyGoldwyn will be hosting an unemployment town hall on how COVID-19 is impacting entertainment workers.   Tune in tomorrow at 7 PM ET to watch live:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/NEMjeyisJx
We will not be defeated.  https://t.co/PSbYSIE4CM
Donald Trump left our country unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime — and now we're paying the price.  https://t.co/aCxcqQqUqw
Donald Trump says he’s a wartime president — it’s time for him to act like one.
Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy.  https://t.co/AYmwnMmDB4
Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It’s always somebody else's fault — never his. It’s unbelievable.  We deserve better from our commander in chief.  https://t.co/ZNEDGwozyu
Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.  Experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved.  Trump failed to take swift action—and we're paying the price.  https://t.co/nyq6DpLOid
President Trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to China and COVID-19 — but the facts don't back him up. Tony Blinken was the Deputy Secretary of State and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. He'll explain.  https://t.co/si3vDHnF2r
The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in China's leaders instead. Now, we're all paying the price.  Let me explain how we got here:  https://t.co/esvCaGki9V
I know the American people will beat this. We’re brave and big-hearted. We’ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation — and we will again.
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover. We need to provide paid sick leave to everyone who needs it immediately.
It's been a big week: President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Senator Warren all endorsed our campaign — and we need your help to keep this momentum going.  I know times are tough, but if you're able, please chip in today:  https://t.co/xMh8n6xLAc
Together, we will defeat Donald Trump.  https://t.co/2nF0qVGGaH
Today’s news that more than 22 million people filed unemployment claims over the last month is devastating. It’s clear more needs to be done to help hardworking Americans—so I’m calling for a bigger, bolder approach to keeping people on the job. Read more:  https://t.co/r65WXgLKLz
These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are.  COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together—not by targeting people of AAPI heritage.  https://t.co/y8vYAQzvsW
Here's the simple truth: This nation has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now. We will overcome this.  https://t.co/7Irkhnbf6I
When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all.
To combat COVID-19, we need a decisive public health response to curb its spread and a comprehensive economic response that delivers real relief to Americans.  I've released several plans outlining exactly what I would do if I were president. Take a look:  https://t.co/YLHCGF1YM9
When somebody is President of the United States, the responsibility is total.  https://t.co/hmhkBymGob
So this week, we’re working through what ours will be. There are a few I know: compassion, kindness, humility, gratitude, and joy. But I want your help. Our supporters have been here from the start—and I want to know: what should be in our campaign’s code?  https://t.co/UoRbb41RHD
We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. And when he fights, we’ll fight harder. But we can’t do it without you.
Mayor @PeteButtigieg’s campaign had a set of “rules of the road” that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it’s a good idea, and one I’d like @TeamJoe to adopt.
In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, “Joey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.” I’m working on building one for our campaign, too.
Managing an economic relief and recovery effort is hard, painstaking work. The devil is in the details. It’s all about follow-through.  I've done the work before, and I'll be ready to do it on day one as president.  https://t.co/a7oCXZqCL2
We are building the movement that will beat Donald Trump.  Join us:  https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW  https://t.co/pHIXCHZ0cm

COVID-19 is amplifying so many inequities in our society. We have to ensure support gets to those who need it immediately, and then do the necessary work to rip out the structural racism that creates these inequalities.  https://t.co/fDUcAdfOHz
The President’s vanity is preventing people from paying their bills.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I’m proud to have the fiercest of fighters, Senator @EWarren, on my side. With her help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump and create a government that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected. Let’s do this.
From my basement to your sneaker room. Tune in Thursday at 11 PM ET on @SHODesusAndMero to watch!
I want Donald Trump to look these folks in the eye and explain to them why they or their loved ones haven’t been able to get tested for COVID-19. We’ve got to do better.  https://t.co/CUY6nmCPjl
Let’s do this.  https://t.co/INkan0GxGL

You have great taste, @SpeakerPelosi.
Stories like this showcase exactly who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We help out folks we've never met, lift each other up, and do our part to ensure we make it through.  We will overcome this, together.
President Obama understands, as I do, that we will come through this crisis stronger. And then we’ll not only rebuild this nation — we will transform it.  https://t.co/nlilxxpA91
Barack — This endorsement means the world to Jill and me. We’re going to build on the progress we made together, and there’s no one I’d rather have standing by my side.
Leadership is about never proclaiming power. It’s about collaboration, it’s about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. It’s about results.    That’s who I am and the role I aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times.
I am not running for office to be King of America. I respect the Constitution. I’ve read the Constitution. I’ve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country’s governors — Democratic and Republican — are doing under these horrific circumstances.
I want to congratulate @judgekarofsky on her hard-earned victory tonight. In the face of rampant voter suppression and GOP recklessness, the people of Wisconsin showed up and made their choice clear. I know Wisconsin will be a fairer, more just state with Jill on the court.
I am grateful to have the support of so many Wisconsinites and proud of the courage and commitment folks showed during last week's primary — but it should never have come to that.  No one should ever have to choose between their health and our democracy.  https://t.co/D4PpzYkter
It shouldn't take a global pandemic shutting down schools to end school shootings.
For months, the Trump Administration was repeatedly warned about the threat COVID-19 posed to our nation. They ignored the experts, failed to take action, and now Americans are paying the price.  https://t.co/YiSTQPnLNy
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. We need a president who actually listens to public health experts.
To Bernie’s supporters: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country.   I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome on this campaign. You’re needed.  https://t.co/vJXlroCdDd

We're facing a crisis unlike any we've faced before — and I couldn't be prouder of how the American people are responding.  https://t.co/wK1mDPDl9b
To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you.
As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes.  https://t.co/SkfH3U792L
Folks, we just released a special Sunday episode of Here’s the Deal! @RevDrBarber joined me for a discussion on faith and its intersection with some of the most pressing issues we face as a nation.  Listen at  https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts.  https://t.co/TJWyyWbVIC

RT @DrBiden: While our family may be physically distancing, our traditions keep us connected. Ready for Easter!  https://t.co/Ay3hkAzlq3
We are in the middle of a global pandemic — and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.
This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together.
We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible. Workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately. There's no time to waste.  https://t.co/XFNZK6m1RV
We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable.  Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act immediately.  https://t.co/wudATlE3wr
Now more than ever, we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.
President Trump needs to do everything in his power to expand the number of testing sites and surge the number of tests. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and finding a way out of this crisis.  https://t.co/WHprzHoGnm
The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. There's nothing we can't do if we do it together.
No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a global pandemic. We need to freeze rent for people who lose their jobs and place a ban on evictions immediately.  https://t.co/0sQYpUHosv
We need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic  —  including the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  —  with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president.  https://t.co/4dvq4uiv17
The folks on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes.  https://t.co/ZBwPwiVTL9
La historia de los EE.UU. es la historia de gente común que hace cosas extraordinarias. Sé que unidos, y como una nación, nosotros somos más fuertes que este virus. Sé que superaremos esto y seremos más fuertes por ello, se lo prometo. No pierdan la fe.  https://t.co/89o4gSMNWF
The health inequities being exposed by COVID-19 are unconscionable.  We can do better. We have to.  https://t.co/2T1hcOas9z
Whether you supported Bernie or any other candidate throughout the primary, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. You're not just welcome — you're needed. And I will do everything I can to earn your vote this November.
America’s story is one of ordinary people doing extraordinary things given half a chance. This virus is tough. But together and as a nation — we're tougher.  I know we’ll get through this and we’ll be stronger for it, I promise you. Keep the faith.  https://t.co/dC8JvRWPMC
The stakes in this election have never been higher. We have to come together and beat Donald Trump.
This virus can hit anyone — regardless of race, economic status, or access to power — but it doesn’t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources.  We have to do better for all our people.  https://t.co/fx76CcIPdU
The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. We need to take extraordinary steps to protect American families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole.
This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims—on top of the millions already filed—is devastating. We have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there.  I'm announcing two new policies to help Americans get the relief they need:  https://t.co/fUlIB2Fra2
I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests — not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis.
We have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. So today, I'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. As president, I will:  - Lower Medicare eligibility to age 60 - Forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families  https://t.co/wtMnhJdCaR
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.
Eleven-year-old Isaac Johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. My advice was simple:  - Stay a safe distance from friends - Sneeze into your elbow - And eat your vegetables  https://t.co/ksPS4Xb7Wm
A total of about 17 million people have filed for unemployment over the last three weeks. This is unprecedented.   The economic devastation that families all across this country are experiencing is not their fault. We've got to take extraordinary steps to protect them.
We're seeing the soul of our nation on full display every day in this crisis — and it makes me so proud to be an American.  https://t.co/PERwpmeL2X
If we come together, we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it.
This nation has never been defeated when we’re together. And we’re not going to be defeated now.

Together we will defeat Donald Trump. But we will also address the climate crisis. We will make college affordable. And we will make health care available to all.  We will not just rebuild this nation – we’ll transform it. And I’m asking you to join me.  https://t.co/vJXlroCdDd
And to Bernie’s supporters: I know that I need to earn your votes. And I know that might take time. But I want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of this moment. I hope you'll join us. You're more than welcome: You're needed.
We know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation – and the need to defeat Donald Trump – above all else. And for that we’re grateful. But we want you to know: we’ll be reaching out. You’ll be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.
To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future.
I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to.  https://t.co/Z6OkCDWFNm
As Jewish families across America and around the world prepare to observe the first night of Passover, Jill and I want to say chag sameach, and offer our very best wishes, to all who are celebrating.  https://t.co/Qg5Wa9ftyT
It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need. Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act to deliver these life-saving supplies.
We’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color &amp; low-income communities—is linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is.  https://t.co/3GD15s3xSy
The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again.
Folks, I know these are tough times, but this crisis has made it clearer than ever how much elections matter — and what a difference it makes who is in the White House. If you can, please chip in to fuel our campaign. I would really appreciate it.   https://t.co/mZbSSmDbN2
@blackenterprise Jill and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Graves family. As the founder of Black Enterprise, Earl Graves Sr. was a trailblazer in his own right, a leader in the American business community, and paved the way for many Black entrepreneurs to realize their dreams.
On #WorldHealthDay, we thank the tireless health care workers fighting COVID-19, and we see clearly why protecting the health of Americans requires U.S. global leadership—to coordinate an international response, strengthen health systems everywhere, and prevent the next pandemic.
Secretary Modly's resignation is appropriate and called for. His disparaging remarks were far beneath the dignity of the office he held. Our sailors, our nation, and Captain Crozier deserve better.

We need a president who actually listens to the experts and heeds their advice.
Mr. President, I hope we can gather in Milwaukee, but that is going to depend on you stepping up and doing what needs to be done to handle this pandemic. I have laid out how you can do that:  https://t.co/YLHCGEKnUB. Happy to discuss anytime.
Folks, our second episode of Here’s the Deal is live! This week, @GovWhitmer joins me for a discussion on COVID-19, President Trump’s personal attacks, and the importance of bipartisanship to deliver results.  Listen at  https://t.co/t11Fa0CorE or wherever you get your podcasts.
It is close to criminal the way they’re dealing with Captain Crozier. He spoke up to protect his sailors — he should have a commendation, not be fired.  https://t.co/ZnadEsljxX
During our Family Town Hall on COVID-19, I was asked what we can do to prevent this from happening again. Here’s where I'd start:  https://t.co/A4M8u9W2SR

During these uncertain times, getting the right information out there is so important.  Myself and @DrBiden had the opportunity to host a conversation about COVID-19 with 3 family vloggers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in now:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq
These health care workers — and all those on the front lines of this fight — are American heroes.
Every day that Donald Trump refuses to use the full power of the Defense Production Act further threatens American lives.
We all want to protect our families — the first step is arming ourselves with the facts.   @DrBiden and I hosted a town hall on COVID-19 with three family YouTubers: ItsJudysLife, J House Vlogs and The Curly Coopers. Tune in tonight at 7PM EDT:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50  https://t.co/gIEPo2PjuO
We are at war with this virus — and the health care workers on the front lines are our soldiers. It is unacceptable that they don’t have the lifesaving masks, gowns, and protective gear they need.
Out of every crisis, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated.  https://t.co/HLR9WBZBhR
Donald Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately. This is no time to put pettiness and ideology above helping those who are in the greatest need.  Lives are at stake.  https://t.co/QbyOXboFbr
Jill and I had the pleasure of hosting a town hall with family vloggers ItsJudysLife, The Curly Coopers, and JHouse Vlogs where we answered their questions about the COVID-19 outbreak.  Tune in to the premiere on Sunday at 7PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/9fqyYsGwMJ
Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it.
We owe so much to those working around the clock to keep our country running during this crisis. The least we can do is provide the pay, benefits, and protections they need and deserve.
We need a Supply Commander to step up and take charge and get the doctors, nurses, health care workers, first responders, firefighters, and cops the equipment they need to protect themselves and save lives.  https://t.co/3OgY1cRGlK
In January, while Donald Trump was downplaying COVID-19, I wrote an op-ed calling for immediate action to combat the growing threat.  In it, I also said Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis.  I stand by that statement.  https://t.co/PH4vF5taDa
Throughout the campaign, I’ve talked a lot about the soul of our nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. There’s so much good happening — people reaching out to one another, neighbors helping neighbors, caring for those in need. It makes me so proud to be an American.
My friend, @GabbyGiffords, knows what it takes to persevere in the face of uncertainty. Take a few minutes to read these powerful words from her on how we can get through this — together.  https://t.co/Kl0OrjB3UG
This is a headline every American should see: “Trump administration ended pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses”  Donald Trump’s shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared to deal with this outbreak.
Those are the kinds of questions Trump will be responsible for. He doesn’t have a great record when it comes to delivering on promises, but I hope this time is different.   Being president is about taking responsibility. The blame game won’t cut it. Too many lives are at stake.
The CARES Act provides money to help working people—how do we make sure it gets to them as quickly as possible?   There’s money for major corporations—how do we make sure that there is rigorous oversight to ensure it is used to help workers and not enrich top executives?
I’ve done this work before. It’s hard, painstaking work.   I was in charge of administering the $800 billion Recovery Act — so I understand that the devil is in the details. It’s about follow-through.
I’ve put together a checklist for making the economic relief and recovery effort work for families, workers, and small businesses. I encourage President Trump to adopt any and all of the ideas.  https://t.co/P5gq7h2rtE
Families across the country are impacted by COVID-19—and it can be especially difficult to explain to children.   Jill and I spoke with ItsJudysLife, JHouseVlogs and The Curly Coopers to answer their questions about the crisis. Tune in on Sunday at 7PM ET:  https://t.co/xk0GcS7PGq  https://t.co/TUQnhOroTU
Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors.  https://t.co/AkGFdlYjwt
This is another clear warning sign that more needs to be done to keep as many people on payroll as possible. Fast, bold action to bolster American workers now will save more pain later. Congress must get to work immediately on the next package. We can't afford to waste time.
Now more than ever, we need to choose hope over fear. We will beat COVID-19. We will overcome this. Together.

Real courage is confronting something that you're afraid to do and doing it anyway. That’s what people across this country are doing every single day in the face of this crisis. They are American heroes.  https://t.co/KQQiU9P8xz
In order for our government to work for all Americans, it's important it be representative of all Americans. With openly LGBTQ individuals only making up .17% of elected officials, we have work to do.  This National #OutToWin Day, I'm asking: Will you run?  https://t.co/QvM6IINN4T
I'm about to roll out my plan to make the economic recovery work. Tune in now:  https://t.co/fLTDvwK1wf
My heart goes out to the millions of Americans who filed unemployment claims in recent weeks, and the millions more who worry what next week holds for them.  Donald Trump needs to take action to ensure Americans receive the economic relief they need as soon as possible.
I know many folks are feeling anxious and worried. I just want you to know that you're not alone. Americans in every corner of the country are feeling the same exact way you are. We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together — and we will overcome this. I promise.
Our health care workers on the front lines of this fight still don’t have the masks, gowns, and other protective equipment they need. It’s unacceptable.  Add your name to demand Donald Trump use his full authority to deliver these lifesaving supplies:  https://t.co/bnHqHEIp1T
The economic damage from this public health crisis is both rising and deepening at an alarming rate. It is putting working families and the American middle class through unimaginable financial pain — and they need to be made whole as fast as possible.  https://t.co/QNuB29JcGy
It's now April, and:  - States still don't have enough tests - Hospitals still don't have enough ventilators - Health care workers still don't have enough masks  Donald Trump needs to use all available authorities immediately to solve these shortages.
At a time when Americans might need health care the most, the Trump Administration is preventing people who need insurance from getting it. Their cruelty truly knows no bounds.  https://t.co/PelIrNxBNQ

It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need.
Thank you to the governors who are meeting this moment with decisive action, a steady hand, and compassionate leadership. Thank you for stepping up when President Trump has not.
The words of a president matter.  https://t.co/OteNK4CWbU
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is preventing people from getting health care.  I can’t believe this needs to be said, but President Trump needs to reopen Obamacare enrollment, and he needs to do it now. Lives are at stake.

As president, I would never send an American soldier anywhere in the world without the equipment and protection they need. We should not do any less for the heroes on the front lines of the battle we’re in now.  https://t.co/ZWNExlKq3H
I'm confident that the American people will meet this moment. There’s never been a challenge we've been unable to overcome if we do it together.
We have to place a temporary ban on evictions nationwide. No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic.
In order to combat COVID-19, we need both a decisive public health response and a decisive economic response. I’ve laid out exactly what I would do if I were president during this crisis, take a look:  https://t.co/Q58OQW6tQO
Our health care workers are putting their lives on the line every day, and our president is accusing them of stealing lifesaving supplies. It's time for Donald Trump to do his job, so our heroes are able to do theirs. Lives are at stake.  https://t.co/qiwRjrVUYz
This is unconscionable. Americans are already afraid of the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is having on their lives — they don't need the added stress of losing their health insurance. Drop the lawsuit.  https://t.co/VyN90rluy9
I know these are confusing and scary times, so for the first episode of our new podcast I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, to help provide some clarity around COVID-19.

The medical professionals on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes — risking their lives in order to save others. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. #NationalDoctorsDay
President Trump should be using the Defense Production Act to get our first responders and health care providers the masks, gowns, and protective equipment they need. This is a matter of life and death.  https://t.co/i4jNeL7yoc
The American people are generous, decent, good, and fair. In times of crisis, we come together as one. We look out for our neighbors and lend a hand to those in need. We will get through this, together. I promise.
Not a joke, folks, we just launched our new podcast. It’s called "Here's the Deal." For our first episode, I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, for a discussion on COVID-19.  Listen at  https://t.co/t11Fa0TZjc or wherever you get your podcasts.
I am issuing this challenge to the President: in the next 48 hours, direct the production and distribution of respirator masks, gloves, protective face shields and gowns to fill every supply request made by a governor to the federal government.   Lives are at stake.
We will overcome this — together.
As president, I will always choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction.
It's hard to read this story and not conclude one thing: The Trump Administration failed the American people.
Instacart needs to step up and give their workers the protections and pay they need and deserve. Now.
Dreamers are Americans. We should never endanger or throw into question their ability to contribute to our nation, but to do so in a moment of national crisis is beyond misguided.  https://t.co/6n7kQbw6QH
The folks working to keep our country running are true heroes — and we need to ensure they have the protections, accommodations, and benefits they need and deserve. We couldn't get through this without them.  https://t.co/eErp14BkuK
Donald Trump’s ego will cost lives.  https://t.co/JNcGny13KO
Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, but it’s even harder when you’re not able to be with them in their final moments — and that’s what’s happening around the country because of the coronavirus. It’s heartbreaking, and I’m keeping everyone affected in my prayers.  https://t.co/vAISTRxi5O
The Administration promised millions of tests by mid-March. But it's not happening fast enough. Where are the tests, Mr. President?
Mr. President, this isn’t about you, it’s about the health of the American people. Stop making everything personal.  You are the president of all 50 states — not just the ones that voted for you or that have governors who “treat you right.” It’s time you acted like it.
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment.
Last night, the great Rev. Joseph E. Lowery passed away, leaving an indelible mark on our country's history towards progress. He never once wavered in his spirit and in the resolve to end injustice — wherever he saw it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
I just wrapped up tonight’s CNN town hall, where we discussed COVID-19 and how we move forward. I know times are tough, but the stakes in this election have never been higher. If you could chip in a few dollars I would really appreciate it.  https://t.co/1PoT5yD9CO
You can't deal with the economic crisis until you deal with the public health crisis. It's a false choice.

This afternoon, I’ll be sitting down for a conversation with nurses, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. Tune in at 4:15 ET to join us:  https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50
Patients need ventilators.  Nurses need equipment.  And Donald Trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it.   I thank God every day for people like @GovWhitmer, who are doing the work he won’t.
The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.  He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.  It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.
It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.  Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price.
The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:  - Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person - Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it - Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine
The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American.  https://t.co/bCyYCFBAML
President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered.  https://t.co/xlLlQCHn3c
Thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight. Your hard work is what makes America run every single day — but especially in times of crisis. We truly couldn't get through this without you.  https://t.co/kr8Q6Me77H
The Trump Administration misled the American people.
We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street.  It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.  If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen.
If I were President, here's what I would do right now:  - Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic - Launch a task force to ensure money rapidly gets to people who need it - Bring leaders of Congress together to build the next deal  https://t.co/F14kf8MRUF

It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we’re seeing Donald Trump do every day.
Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge — together.
The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work:  https://t.co/RmcOh0rRPL
"If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June."  Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives.  https://t.co/83kiIngP6o
In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.  Trump has failed our country at a time when we need him most.  https://t.co/d2vxUHGiH0

The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done.
The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.  No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow.
President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price.  https://t.co/HCNDWim5Oc
As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now.  https://t.co/T3pFw3DQlj

The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
It has been a month since this tweet.
I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together.
As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.  No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives.  https://t.co/aSgzVzOvlV
In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”  In February, he said it would disappear.  Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”  Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price.
Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.  We will overcome this, together.
Where are the tests? Where are the masks? Where are the ventilators?  The American people deserve answers, Mr. President.  https://t.co/N2MWYKOzOu
Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need.  https://t.co/aXqHL7LN9f
A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their CEOs.  It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first.
During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care.  https://t.co/PlfeFNwhG2
What is President Trump waiting for?   Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.  Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe.  He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it.
I'm about to deliver remarks on the Coronavirus pandemic. Tune in to watch live:  https://t.co/HpaqlEb7D1
President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put a corporate bailout ahead of families. It's simply wrong. We need to be focused on helping hardworking Americans, communities, and small businesses — not handing big corporations a blank check.  https://t.co/tMBZm26h3y
It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check.  https://t.co/pxGrnTYebF
President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history.   https://t.co/pFIoZCJWmH
In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right.
We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now.
Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again.
On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”  That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.  We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period.
No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs.
No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks.
It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families.
We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing.
Mr. President — stop lying and start acting. Use the full extent of your authorities, now, to ensure that we are producing all essential goods and delivering them where they need to go.
In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.  Donald Trump is incapable of doing that.  https://t.co/0I7ZYNtqCV
We need action, not more empty words from President Trump. It’s time for him to step up and do his job.  https://t.co/TBpXhoAg1P
Donald Trump has failed the American people.  https://t.co/HsNl9M4h4r
Everyone knows that we're facing a real crisis from the coronavirus. But do you know how we got here and what we need to do next? Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, breaks it down for us:  https://t.co/XRkIw2EzM4
The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.  The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.  Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.  We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs.
From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise.
The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns.
In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus.
If you have a minute, read these stories of folks coming together and helping out their neighbors. They represent who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We look out for each other. And that’s how we’ll get through this — together.  https://t.co/rardKq7Dtd
The President says no one cares about being tested.  Have you or a loved one had trouble getting tested?
Getting money quickly to families is the right goal, but Senate Republicans are proposing to send significantly lower amounts to low-income families than those with higher incomes. That’s terrible economics &amp; terrible values. We should be targeting help to those who need it most.
The lack of coronavirus testing in the U.S. is a national disgrace.  https://t.co/kD9cEFtAUR
The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections.
Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices.
I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees.
.@SenGillibrand has never been afraid to speak without fear, to be brave in the face of injustice, and to empower others to get off the sidelines. I'm thrilled and honored to have her support.
The words of a president matter, and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19 and mislead the American people. He is unfit to lead us through this crisis.
This administration is truly morally bankrupt.
Every worker on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 deserves protections and accommodations that keep them and their families safe. I'm glad to see states stepping up to support folks — employers must do the same.
My prayers go out to all those on the front lines of this crisis.  https://t.co/KfNNRsdS7I
Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?
Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words.
.@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.
This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.  When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together.
The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.  Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price.
Our campaign is building the broad coalition we need to win in November.  https://t.co/cINCXLJnn0
I give you my word as a Biden: When I'm president, I will lead with science, listen to the experts and heed their advice, and always tell you the truth.
It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
We need comprehensive action to combat the coronavirus outbreak. That's why I'm calling for a decisive public health response to curb its spread and provide treatment to those in need, and a decisive economic response that delivers real relief.  https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3
I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.
Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job.

Much has been made of changes in President Trump's tone in recent days. But with our health care system at risk, a virus spreading, our economy on the brink — and so many lives at stake — it’s time to be less interested in his words and more focused on his actions — or inaction.
In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. Volunteers raise their hands to help. Neighbors look out for neighbors. Businesses take care of their workers. That's who we are.  We can and will meet this challenge — together.  https://t.co/xGcTQuc2gB
The next president will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize our country and our allies to rapidly meet new challenges — like future pandemics.  We need a leader who will be ready on day one.  https://t.co/oizwBqv4Wd
Thank you, Arizona!

This crisis requires a decisive economic response. We need to do whatever it takes to deliver relief for our families and ensure the stability of our economy.
Elections are happening today in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. I encourage folks to vote by mail or curbside vote if you can. If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and stay 6’ from others in line. Learn more:  https://t.co/yzZZp4uKFk
My mom always said, "Being Irish is about faith, family, and courage."

Michigan’s response has far outpaced the federal government’s in this crisis. Gov. Whitmer is leading decisively, while you are live-tweeting her appearances on cable news.  We need a president who will do their job and lead this country.
Thank you, Washington!
Coronavirus is bigger than any one of us. Please take care of yourself, wash your hands, and practice social distancing. We will get through this — together.  https://t.co/133eiugfnJ

We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump threatens everything we stand for, he has:  - Fanned the flames of hate - Embraced white supremacists - Separated families at the border - Threatened our democracy  We have to get him out of the White House.
The coronavirus pandemic is bigger than any one individual. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the country and around the world — to solve this crisis.  https://t.co/cbPrIYyjsa
In the wake of the coronavirus, we need a major bailout package that delivers real relief to the American people — not more handouts for giant corporations.  https://t.co/Fi8SwNXDU5
Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits.
We need a president who will always choose science over fiction.

We have to treat climate change like the existential threat it is. As president, I will:  - End subsidies for fossil fuel corporations - Ban new drilling on federal lands &amp; waters - Hold oil executives accountable - Rally the world to raise the commitments of the Paris Agreement

Bernie Sanders voted against comprehensive immigration reform — and then went on TV with Lou Dobbs to brag about it.  Immigrants don't take our jobs. They create jobs. And we need a President who believes that to his or her core. #DemDebate  https://t.co/lHePLtlTpo
My running mate will be a woman. #DemDebate
If Senator @BernieSanders is the nominee, I will throw my full weight behind his campaign and do everything I can to get him elected. If I am the nominee, I hope he will do the same. Nothing can keep us from being united in the fight to defeat Trump. #DemDebate
Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times.   We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures.
I took on Paul Ryan's cuts to Medicare and Social Security — to his face. #DemDebate  https://t.co/wXp61eg5lf
People need help now. Not four years from now. Not eight years from now. We need a health care plan that can pass. #DemDebate
Senator @BernieSanders' attacks on my record on Social Security are a bunch of malarkey — and @PolitiFact agrees.  We should be focused on going after Donald Trump — not fellow Democrats. #DemDebate  https://t.co/PEfKDyUBlW
All those people Bernie says he cares about would have been in deep trouble without the bailout in 2008/2009. It was about saving the economy — and I agree with Bernie, some bank executives should have gone to jail. #DemDebate
People want results, not a revolution. #DemDebate
This is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying to come together. #DemDebate
This is a crisis. We’re at war with a virus.   No one should have to pay for coronavirus health care costs. #DemDebate
We need leadership that listens to science.   We need leaders who listen to experts and heed their advice.   We need American leadership that will rally the world to meet global threats.   We need leaders who are honest.   That is the responsibility of a president.  https://t.co/zcdYiNWRCf
When we have a coronavirus vaccine ready to go, it should be made widely available, free of charge. Period.
This primary has brought out our party's best ideas, and our nation is better for it. If I'm President, I'll continue to bring the best ideas from all corners of the country and fight to make them reality. To see these plans, you can go to my website:  https://t.co/8bAii5T2FF
Second: Few people in the country understand how bankruptcy hurts working families more than Elizabeth Warren. Today, I am fully endorsing and adopting her bankruptcy plan, which she called "Fixing Our Bankruptcy System to Give People a Second Chance."
First: Bernie has put forward a plan that would make public colleges and universities free for families whose income is below $125,000. It's a good idea, and after consideration, I am proud to add it to my platform.
Across the country, middle and working class families are being squeezed by debt. This is a massive problem, and one that we need all of the best ideas to solve. That's why today, I'm adopting two plans from @BernieSanders and @ewarren to achieve this.
No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better.  https://t.co/FwxXvfTchd
I'm incredibly grateful for @SpeakerPelosi's leadership every day — but especially in times of crisis. @senatemajldr McConnell should bring back the Senate immediately and pass this important bill to provide relief for American families.
If you're exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 — or might be at risk — absentee or vote by mail options are the best way to make your voice heard, while protecting your neighbors.
The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is. State election officials are working closely with public health officials to hold safe elections. If you are feeling healthy, not showing symptoms, and not at risk of being exposed to COVID-19: please vote on Tuesday.
The coronavirus will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or zip code. It will touch people in positions of power and the most vulnerable in our society.  We need to take action to combat it.   https://t.co/6TVMKr9ygx  https://t.co/E7J9olEhIR
The American people have the capacity to meet this moment. We will come together, look out for one another, and harness the ingenuity of our scientists. We can and will meet this challenge—together.  https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
This crisis requires a national response. Not just from our elected leaders, or public health officials—but from all of us. We must follow the guidance of the @CDCgov and health officials and take appropriate precautions to protect ourselves and, critically, to protect others.
I know many are anxious about the spread of the coronavirus and the threat it poses. And my thoughts are with all those affected, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others, and everyone making sacrifices to stop the spread.
The White House is no place for on-the-job training — Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus has made that even more clear. We need a president who is ready to clean up his mess, take responsibility, and lead us forward on day one.

Whether you supported Pete, Amy, Beto, or any other candidate in this race — know that there is a home for you in our campaign. I will do everything I can to earn your vote.

.@BetoORourke mobilized a state, inspired a nation, and in the wake of the shooting in El Paso showed us all what compassionate leadership looks like. He will be changing this nation for years to come. I'm so grateful he's on our team.  https://t.co/3d4JZm0FNS
I can't tell you how much Senator @AmyKlobuchar's endorsement means to me. From the moment she announced, it wasn’t hard to see she had the grit and determination to do anything she sets her mind to. That's why I'm confident that we'll beat Donald Trump, together.  https://t.co/M89h5rFLLC

Grateful beyond words to have @PeteButtigieg’s endorsement. A guy of enormous integrity. Someone who has as much moral courage as he has physical courage. Welcome to the team, Mayor Pete.  https://t.co/nLmO13pYHN
This fall, Donald Trump will be trying to get the Supreme Court to strike down Obamacare — ripping insurance away from 30 million people.  I’ll be fighting to end his administration, and to secure for every American the peace of mind that comes from having affordable health care.
Proud to have Pete on the trail with me today. Our number one priority is to beat Donald Trump and bring unity back to our party. Together we're gonna make it happen.  Welcome to the team, @PeteButtigieg! Watch live:  https://t.co/BAnAkX5oqH

Bernie Sanders has gone after nearly every corporation in the world — except the gun manufacturers. It's unacceptable. We need a president with the courage to take them on and ensure they can be held accountable for the carnage they have caused.  https://t.co/nebCfE05gW

If you want a Democratic nominee who will:  - Build on Obamacare — not scrap it - Take on the @NRA and gun manufacturers — not protect them - Stand up for the middle class — not raise their taxes and make promises that can’t be kept  Then this is your campaign.
I'm incredibly honored to have the support of @latinovictoryus. Latinos are the future. They must have a voice — and as president, I will do all in my power to amplify that voice.  https://t.co/EsdccBqXbW

Only Donald Trump could make the coronavirus about him. This president is dangerous.
I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future than I am today. If we come together and unite this country, there’s not a single thing we can’t accomplish.

We are at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward as a nation.  It won’t be easy. But we can do it, together.  https://t.co/pR7zzOqyzI
